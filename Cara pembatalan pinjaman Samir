## Overview

Connectivity refers to Identity Security Cloud's (ISC) ability to connect to many different [sources](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html) of many different types. Organizations can then manage access to the different sources and ensure that the access is secure.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

## Discuss

The most valuable resource for ISC developers is the SailPoint Developer Community itself, where ISC users and experts all over the world come together to ask questions and provide solutions.

To learn more about ISC connectivity and discuss it with SailPoint Developer Community members, go to the [SailPoint Developer Community Forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss/c/isc/6).
