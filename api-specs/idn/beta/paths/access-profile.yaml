    A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a
    SOURCE_SUBADMIN may only use this API to patch Access Profiles which are associated with Sources they are able to
    administer.

    >  The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters.
    Longer descriptions will be preserved for existing access profiles, however, any new access profiles as well as any updates to existing descriptions will be limited to 2000 characters.
