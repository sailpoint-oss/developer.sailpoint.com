  summary:
    Generate a totp secret embedded within a totp link for use with an
    authenticator
  description: >-
    For a user who is not currently registered for MFA, generates a secret to
    share with the user's chosen authenticator app. 

    Request requires a unique header as proof of partial authentication called
    'slpt-auth-mfa', and it must contain a special  MFA token for calling this
    endpoint. 

    While no specific right is required for a user to generate a secret, it is
    expected that the caller first verify that  the user is associated with an
    auth profile that has MFA enabled.
