    Use this API to get a list of all campaign templates. Scope can be reduced through standard V3 query params. Though this Beta endpoint has been deprecated, you can find its V3 equivalent [here](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/get-campaign-templates).

    The endpoint returns all campaign templates matching the query parameters.
