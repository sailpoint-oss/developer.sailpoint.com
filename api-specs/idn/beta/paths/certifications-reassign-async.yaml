  summary: Reassign certifications asynchronously
  description: >-
    This API initiates a task to reassign up to 500 identities or items in a certification to another reviewer. The
    `certification-tasks` API can be used to get an updated status on the task and determine when the reassignment is
    complete. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is required to call this API. Reviewers for this
    certification can also call this API.
