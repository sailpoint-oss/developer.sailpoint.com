  summary: Invite identities to register
  description: |
    This API submits a task for inviting given identities via email to complete registration. The invitation email will include the link. After selecting the link an identity will be able to set up password and log in into the system. Invitations expire after 7 days. By default invitations send to the work identity email. It can be changed in Admin > Identities > Identity Profiles by selecting corresponding profile and editing Invitation Options.
    
    This task will send an invitation email only for unregistered identities.
    
    The executed task status can be checked by Task Management > [Get task status by ID](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-task-status).
