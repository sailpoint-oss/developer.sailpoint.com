    Process identities under the profile

    This operation should not be used to schedule your own identity processing or to perform system wide identity refreshes. The system will use a combination of [event-based processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#event-based-processing) and [scheduled processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#scheduled-processing) that runs every day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM in the tenant's timezone to keep your identities synchronized. 

    This should only be run on identity profiles that have the `identityRefreshRequired` attribute set to `true`. If `identityRefreshRequired` is false, then there is no benefit to running this operation. Typically, this operation is performed when a change is made to the identity profile or its related lifecycle states that requires a refresh.

    This operation will perform the following activities on all identities under the identity profile.

    1. Updates identity attribute according to the identity profile mappings.
    2. Determines the identity's correct manager through manager correlation.
    3. Updates the identity's access according to their assigned lifecycle state.
    4. Updates the identity's access based on role assignment criteria.

    A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.
