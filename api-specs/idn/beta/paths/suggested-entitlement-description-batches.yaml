    List Sed Batches.

    API responses with Sed Batch Records
  parameters:
    - name: offset
      in: query
      description: |-
        Offset

        Integer specifying the offset of the first result from the beginning of the collection. The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results).
        The offset value is record-based, not page-based, and the index starts at 0.
      schema:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        default: 0
        x-go-name: Offset
      example: 0
      required: false
      x-go-name: Offset
    - name: limit
      in: query
      description: |-
        Limit

        Integer specifying the maximum number of records to return in a single API call. The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results).
        If it is not specified, a default limit is used.
      schema:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        maxLength: 250
        minLength: 0
        default: 250
        x-go-name: Limit
      example: 250
      required: false
      x-go-name: Limit
    - name: count
      in: query
      description: >-
        If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored. 

        The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results).

        Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send `count=true` if that value will not be used.
      schema:
        type: boolean
        default: false
      example: true
      required: false
    - name: count-only
      in: query
      description: >-
        If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored.

        This parameter differs from the count parameter in that this one skips executing the actual query and always return an empty array.

      schema:
        type: boolean
        default: false
      example: true
      required: false
    - name: status
      in: query
      description: Batch Status
      schema:
        type: string
      example: completed, failed, submitted, materialized, failed
      required: false
