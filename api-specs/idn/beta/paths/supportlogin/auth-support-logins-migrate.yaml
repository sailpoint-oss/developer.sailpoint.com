  summary: Migrate auth support login records
  description: >-
    Migrates all the auth support login access grants from the specified auth
    tenant to the new auth tenant in the request context, resulting in the new
    auth tenant having possession of all the old auth tenant's auth support
    login access grants and the old auth tenant no longer having any more auth
    support login access grants.

    Because this is a highly privileged operation meant only to be executable by
    SailPoint DevOps, this request requires the following security scope:
    **sp:auth-support-login-transfer:update**
  parameters:
    - in: path
      name: oldAuthTenant
      description: >-
        The name of auth tenant whose auth support login access grants will be
        migrated to the calling auth tenant
