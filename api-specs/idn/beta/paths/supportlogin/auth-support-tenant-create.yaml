summary: Create auth support tenant record
description: >-
  This request will create an auth support tenant record for the tenant making
  the call, making that tenant the auth tenant in the new record. This new
  record will function as a prerequisite metadata reference for when a target
  tenant attempts to create an auth support login record that grants access to a
  particular auth tenant. Thus, a target tenant must name an auth tenant that
  exists within an auth support tenant record in order to successfully create an
  auth support login record.

  Request will require the following security scope:
  **sp:auth-support-login:create**
