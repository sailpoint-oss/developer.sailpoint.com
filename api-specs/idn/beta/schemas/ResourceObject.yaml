properties:
  instance:
    description: Identifier of the specific instance where this object resides.
    type: string
    readOnly: true
  identity:
    description: Native identity of the object in the Source.
    type: string
    example: 'CN=Aaron Carr,OU=test1,DC=test2,DC=test'
    readOnly: true
  uuid:
    description: Universal unique identifier of the object in the Source.
    type: string
    example: '{abf7bd9b-68b4-4d21-9b70-870c58ebf844}'
    readOnly: true
  previousIdentity:
    description: Native identity that the object has previously.
    type: string
    readOnly: true
  name:
    description: Display name for this object.
    type: string
    example: 'Aaron Carr'
    readOnly: true
  objectType:
    description: Type of object.
    type: string
    example: 'account'
    readOnly: true
  incomplete:
    description: >-
      A flag indicating that this is an incomplete object.
      Used in special cases where the connector has to return account information in several phases and the objects
      might not have a complete set of all account attributes. The attributes in this object will replace the
      corresponding attributes in the Link, but no other Link attributes will be changed.
    type: boolean
    example: false
    readOnly: true
  incremental:
    description: >-
      A flag indicating that this is an incremental change object.
      This is similar to incomplete but it also means that the values of any multi-valued attributes in this object
      should be merged with the existing values in the Link rather than replacing the existing Link value.
    type: boolean
    example: false
    readOnly: true
  delete:
    description: >-
      A flag indicating that this object has been deleted.
      This is set only when doing delta aggregation and the connector supports detection of native deletes.
    type: boolean
    example: false
    readOnly: true
  remove:
    description: >-
      A flag set indicating that the values in the attributes represent things to remove rather than things to add.
      Setting this implies incremental. The values which are always for multi-valued attributes are removed from
      the current values.
    type: boolean
    example: false
    readOnly: true
  missing:
    description: >-
      A list of attribute names that are not included in this object.
      This is only used with SMConnector and will only contain "groups".
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    example: [ "missFieldOne", "missFieldTwo" ]
    readOnly: true
  attributes:
    description: Attributes of this ResourceObject.

    example: {
      "telephoneNumber": "12-(345)678-9012",
      "mail": "example@test.com",
      "displayName": "Aaron Carr"
    }
    readOnly: true
  finalUpdate:
    description: >-
      In Aggregation, for sparse object the count for total accounts scanned identities updated is not incremented.
    type: boolean
    example: false
    readOnly: true
