title: Segment Change Assignments
description: >-
    A request to make multiple assignment changes to a segment. 
properties:
    assignments:
        type: array
        items:
            $ref: '../../v3/schemas/BareReference.yaml'
        nullable: true
        description: >-
          List of references to objects which will be assigned the Segment. All references must be of type ROLE or
          ACCESS_PROFILE. If a referenced object is already assigned the Segment, the new assignment will be silently
          ignored. However, it is an error for the same object to be referenced in both the *assignments* and *removals*
          lists.
        example:
          - type: "ROLE"
            id: "2c918086750a21d701751e71ee121518"
          - type: "ACCESS_PROFILE"
            id: "2c918086750a2e129f1518161919ecca"

        nullable: true

          List of references to objects which will be removed from the Segment. All references must be of type ROLE or
          ACCESS_PROFILE. If a referenced object is not assigned the Segment, the new removal will be silently
          ignored. However, it is an error for the same object to be referenced in both the *assignments* and *removals*
          lists.
        example:

            id: "2c918086750a21d701751e71e73a0289"
          - type: "ACCESS_PROFILE"
            id: "2c91808676fd514b017702bdc826024a"
