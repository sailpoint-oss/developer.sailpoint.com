      This doesn't normally have to be the name of an existing identity in ISC, but it does if you have an active subscription to the [Access Request Decision trigger](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/access-request-decision).
      If you don't provide the `username` of an existing identity in your tenant, your Access Request Decision subscriptions will never trigger.
    example: AcmeCorpExternalIntegration
