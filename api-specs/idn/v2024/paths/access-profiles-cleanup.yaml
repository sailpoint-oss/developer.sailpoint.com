  summary: Cleanup invalid access profiles.
  description: >-
    Used by internal services to cleanup invalid access profiles in the system. An access profile is considered invalid,
    if it contains no valid entitlements. The references to the deleted entitlements should be cleaned up from the
    invalid access profiles. Then the access profiles are disabled. According to the current implementation, this API is
    scheduled to be called by a periodic task once a day at 12:00 AM.
