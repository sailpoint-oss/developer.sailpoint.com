  summary: Confirm a user's registration for mfa
  description: >-
    For a user who is not currently registered for MFA and who has just scanned
    the QR code containing the TOTP URL provided by the /generate-secret
    endpoint, confirms registration for MFA by validating a new TOTP code
    generated by the authenticator used to scan the QR code containing the TOTP
    URL.

    Request requires a unique header as proof of partial authentication. This
    header is called 'slpt-auth-mfa', and it must contain a special  MFA token
    for calling this endpoint. 

    While no specific right is required for a user to confirm registration, it
    is expected that the caller first make a request to the /generate-secret
    endpoint so that a TOTP secret exists as a basis for registration
    confirmation. It is also assumed that the caller has previously verified
    that the user is  associated with an auth profile that has MFA enabled.
