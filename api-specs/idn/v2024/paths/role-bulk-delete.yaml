  description: >-
    This endpoint initiates a bulk deletion of one or more roles.

    When the request is successful, the endpoint returns the bulk delete's task result ID. 
    To follow the task, you can use [Get Task Status by ID](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-task-status), which will return the task result's status and information. 

    This endpoint can only bulk delete up to a limit of 50 roles per request. 

    A user with ROLE_SUBADMIN authority can only call this endpoint if all roles included in the request are associated
    with sources with management workgroups the ROLE_SUBADMIN is a member of.
