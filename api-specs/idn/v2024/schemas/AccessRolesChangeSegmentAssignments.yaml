description: >-
  A request to make segment assignment changes to multiple roles and access-profiles.
required:
  - "segmentId"
properties:
  segmentId:
    type: string
    description: The ID of the Segment
    example: ab5fc0cd-e021-4b76-96e6-4818df0d73d5
  assignments:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: './BareReference.yaml'
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      List of references to objects which will be assigned the Segment. All references must be of type ROLE or
      ACCESS_PROFILE. If a referenced object is already assigned the Segment, the new assignment will be silently
      ignored. However, it is an error for the same object to be referenced in both the *assignments* and *removals*
      lists.
    example:
      - type: "ROLE"
        id: "2c918086750a21d701751e71ee121518"
      - type: "ACCESS_PROFILE"
        id: "2c918086750a2e129f1518161919ecca"
  removals:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: './BareReference.yaml'
    nullable: true
    description: >-
      List of references to objects which will be removed from the Segment. All references must be of type ROLE or
      ACCESS_PROFILE. If a referenced object is not assigned the Segment, the new removal will be silently
      ignored. However, it is an error for the same object to be referenced in both the *assignments* and *removals*
      lists.
    example:
      - type: "ROLE"
        id: "2c918086750a21d701751e71e73a0289"
      - type: "ACCESS_PROFILE"
