  sourceName:
    type: string

  attributeName:
    type: string
    description:
      The name of the attribute on the account to return. This should match the
      name of the account attribute name visible in the user interface, or on

    example: DEPARTMENT
  accountSortAttribute:
    type: string
    description:
      The value of this configuration is a string name of the attribute to use
      when determining the ordering of returned accounts when there are multiple
      entries
    example: created
    default: created
  accountSortDescending:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      The value of this configuration is a boolean (true/false). Controls the
      order of the sort when there are multiple accounts. If not defined, the
      transform will default to false (ascending order)
    example: false
    default: false
  accountReturnFirstLink:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      The value of this configuration is a boolean (true/false). Controls which
      account to source a value from for an attribute.  If this flag is set to
      true, the transform returns the value from the first account in the list,
      even if it is null. If it is set to false, the transform returns the first
      non-null value. If not defined, the transform will default to false
    example: false
    default: false
  accountFilter:
    type: string
    description: >-
      This expression queries the database to narrow search results. The value
      of this configuration is a sailpoint.object.Filter expression and used
      when searching against the database.  The default filter will always
      include the source and identity, and any subsequent expressions will be
      combined in an AND operation to the existing search criteria.

      Only certain searchable attributes are available: 
      - `nativeIdentity` - the Account ID 
      - `displayName` - the Account Name 
      - `entitlements` - a boolean value to determine if the account has entitlements
    example: "!(nativeIdentity.startsWith(\"*DELETED*\"))"
  accountPropertyFilter:
    type: string
    description: >-
      This expression is used to search and filter accounts in memory. The value
      of this configuration is a sailpoint.object.Filter expression and used
      when searching against the returned resultset.


      All account attributes are available for filtering as this operation is
      performed in memory.
    example: "(groups.containsAll({'Admin'}) || location == 'Austin')"
