  summary: Va cluster status change
  operationId: vaClusterStatusChangeEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC) runs a health check on a virtual appliance (VA) cluster, and the cluster's health status is different from the previous health check, such as a change from healthy to unhealthy or the opposite. 
    VA cluster health checks run every 30 minutes.
    Users can use this trigger to monitor all their VA clusters' health status changes.
    
    These are some typical use cases for the trigger:
      * Create real-time health dashboards for VA clusters.
      * Notify an admin or system to take appropriate actions when a VA cluster's health status changes.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
