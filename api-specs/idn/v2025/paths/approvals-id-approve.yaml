  summary: Post Approvals Approve
  description: >-
    Currently this endpoint only supports Entitlement Description Approvals.
    
    Approves a specified approval request on behalf of the caller. This endpoint is for generic approvals, unlike the access-request-approval endpoint, and does not include access-request-approvals. The approval request must be in a state that allows it to be approved.
    
    If called by an admin and the admin is not listed as an approver, the approval request will be reassigned from a random approver to the admin user.
