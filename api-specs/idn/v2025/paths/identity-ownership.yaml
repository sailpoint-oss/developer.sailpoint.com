  description: "Use this API to return an identity's owned objects that will cause\
    \ problems for deleting the identity. \nUse this API as a checklist of objects\
    \ that you need to reassign to a different identity before you can delete the\
    \ identity. \nFor a full list of objects owned by an identity, use the [Search\
    \ API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v3/search-post/).  When you search\
    \ for identities, the returned identities have a property, `owns`, that contains\
    \ a more comprehensive list of identity's owned objects."
