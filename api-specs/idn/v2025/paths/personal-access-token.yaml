  summary: Patch personal access token
  description: >-
    This performs a targeted update to the field(s) of a Personal Access Token.

    Changing scopes for a Personal Access Token does not impact existing bearer tokens. You will need to create a new bearer token to have the new scopes. Please note that it can take up to 20 minutes for scope changes to be seen on new bearer tokens.

    **expirationDate and userAwareTokenNeverExpires Relationship:**
    
    **Important:** When `expirationDate` is `null` or empty (replaced to `null` or omitted from the patch request), the token will never expire.
    
    **Required Validation:** If `expirationDate` is being replaced to `null` or is empty, `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` must be set to `true` in the patch request. This is a required validation rule.
    
    When patching `expirationDate` and `userAwareTokenNeverExpires`, the valid values for `expirationDate` depend on the value provided for `userAwareTokenNeverExpires`:
    
    * **When `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` is being set to `true` (or required to be `true`):** `expirationDate` can be replaced to `null` or omitted from the patch request. When `expirationDate` is `null` or empty, the token will never expire. This sets the PAT to never expire and serves as an explicit acknowledgment that the user is aware of the security implications of creating a non-expiring token.
    * **When `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` is `false` or omitted:** `expirationDate` must be provided and must be a valid date-time string representing a future date (there is no upper limit). `expirationDate` cannot be `null` in this case. In this scenario, `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` can be omitted.
    
    **Validation Rules:**
    * **If `expirationDate` is being replaced to `null`:** `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` must also be present in the patch request with a value of `true` (required). The token will never expire.
    * **If `expirationDate` is not being replaced to `null` (i.e., set to a future date):** `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` can be omitted.
    
    **Security Considerations:**
    The `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` field is designed to ensure that users explicitly acknowledge the security implications of creating tokens that never expire. Setting this field to `true` indicates that the user understands the increased security risks and has made an informed decision to proceed.
    
    **Note:** The `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` field indicates that the user acknowledges they are creating a token that will never expire. It does not affect token behavior beyond indicating this acknowledgment.
