    This gets a collection of personal access tokens associated with the optional `owner-id`. 
    query parameter. If the `owner-id` query parameter is omitted, all personal access tokens 
    for a tenant will be retrieved, but the caller must have the 'idn:all-personal-access-tokens:read' right.
    
  parameters:
    - in: query
      name: owner-id
      description: >-
        The identity ID of the owner whose personal access tokens should be listed. 
        If "me", the caller should have the following right: 'idn:my-personal-access-tokens:read'
        
        If an actual owner ID or if the `owner-id` parameter is omitted in the request, 
        the caller should have the following right: 'idn:all-personal-access-tokens:read'. 
        
        If the caller has the following right, then managed personal access tokens associated with `owner-id` 
        will be retrieved: 'idn:managed-personal-access-tokens:read'

  summary: Create personal access token
  description: >-
    This creates a personal access token.
    
    **expirationDate and userAwareTokenNeverExpires Relationship:**
    
    **Important:** When `expirationDate` is `null` or empty (not included in the request body), the token will never expire.
    
    **Required Validation:** If `expirationDate` is `null` or empty, `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` must be set to `true`. This is a required validation rule.
    
    The valid values for `expirationDate` depend on the value provided for `userAwareTokenNeverExpires`:
    
    * **When `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` is `true` (or required to be `true`):** `expirationDate` can be `null` or omitted from the request body. When `expirationDate` is `null` or empty, the token will never expire. This creates a PAT that never expires and serves as an explicit acknowledgment that the user is aware of the security implications of creating a non-expiring token.
    * **When `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` is `false` or omitted:** `expirationDate` must be provided and must be a valid date-time string representing a future date (there is no upper limit). `expirationDate` cannot be `null` in this case. In this scenario, `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` can be omitted.
    
    **Validation Rules:**
    * **If `expirationDate` is `null` or not included in the request body:** `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` must be set to `true` (required). The token will never expire.
    * **If `expirationDate` is provided and is not `null`:** `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` can be omitted.
    
    **Security Considerations:**
    The `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` field is designed to ensure that users explicitly acknowledge the security implications of creating tokens that never expire. Setting this field to `true` indicates that the user understands the increased security risks and has made an informed decision to proceed.
    
    **Note:** The `userAwareTokenNeverExpires` field indicates that the user acknowledges they are creating a token that will never expire. It does not affect token behavior beyond indicating this acknowledgment.
    
  requestBody:
    description: >-
      Configuration for creating a personal access token, including name, scope, expiration settings, and user acknowledgment of never-expiring tokens.
      
      **Important:** See the endpoint description for validation rules regarding the relationship between `expirationDate` and `userAwareTokenNeverExpires`.
