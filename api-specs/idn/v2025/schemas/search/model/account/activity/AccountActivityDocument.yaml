      ISO-8601 date-time referring to the date-time when object was queued to be synced into search database for use in the search API.  

      This date-time changes anytime there is an update to the object, which triggers a synchronization event being sent to the search database. 

      There may be some delay between the `synced` time and the time when the updated data is actually available in the search API.
