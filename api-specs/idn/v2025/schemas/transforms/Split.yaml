    type: boolean
    description: |
      A boolean (true/false) value which indicates whether an exception should be thrown and returned as an output when an index is out of bounds with the resultant array (i.e., the provided index value is larger than the size of the array)
      

      `true` - The transform should return "IndexOutOfBoundsException"

      
      `false` - The transform should return null
      
      
      If not provided, the transform will default to false and return a null
    example: true
    default: false
