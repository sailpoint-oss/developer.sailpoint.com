  summary: Scheduled search
  operationId: scheduledSearchEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after Identity Security Cloud (ISC) generates a report from a saved search. 

    In ISC, users can subscribe to saved searches to receive an email report generated by the saved search.
    They can then set a schedule for when those saved searches generate reports, such as daily at 6:00 GMT. 
    The trigger can notify an external HTTP application that ISC has generated a report from a saved search and the report is ready to be processed. 

    These are some typical use cases for the trigger:
      * Perform continous checks for Separation of Duties (SOD) violations, for quality control.
      * Respond to upcoming Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) scenarios, such as deprovisioning access before an employee's separation date. 

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
