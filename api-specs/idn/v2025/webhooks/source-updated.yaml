  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when a new source's configuration is changed in Identity Security Cloud (ISC).

    These are some typical use cases for the trigger:
      * Provide evidence to auditors to show that connector logic and sources are maintained by proper change control processes and aren't vulnerable to outside manipulation. 
      * Trigger review for an updated source. 

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
