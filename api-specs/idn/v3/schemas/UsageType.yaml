  The type of provisioning policy usage. 

  In IdentityNow, a source can support various provisioning operations. For example, when a joiner is added to a source, this may trigger both CREATE and UPDATE provisioning operations. 
  Each usage type is considered a provisioning policy. 
  A source can have any number of these provisioning policies defined. 

  These are the common usage types: 

  CREATE - This usage type relates to 'Create Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be created. For example, this would be used for a joiner on a source.  

  UPDATE - This usage type relates to 'Update Account Profile', the provisioning template for the 'Update' connector operations. For example, this would be used for an attribute sync on a source.

  ENABLE - This usage type relates to 'Enable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be enabled. For example, this could be used for a joiner on a source once the joiner's account is created. 

  DISABLE - This usage type relates to 'Disable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be disabled. For example, this could be used when a leaver is removed temporarily from a source. 

  You can use these four usage types for all your provisioning policy needs.
