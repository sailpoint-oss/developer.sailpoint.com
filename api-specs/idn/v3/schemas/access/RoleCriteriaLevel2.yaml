            String value to test the Identity attribute, Account attribute, or Entitlement specified in the key w/r/t
            the specified operation. If this criteria is a leaf node, that is, if the operation is one of
            EQUALS, NOT_EQUALS, CONTAINS, STARTS_WITH, or ENDS_WITH, this field is required. Otherwise, specifying it
            is an error.
