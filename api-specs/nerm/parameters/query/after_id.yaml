name: after_id
in: query
description: Represents the ID where the query should begin from. If blank, it represents the first ID. When used, forces sorting by ID ascending and does not allow use of `offset`. When `after_id` is specified it changes the mode of the API such that any filter parameters other than `profile_type_id`, `limit`, and `offset` are not supported and will be either silently ignored or result in an HTTP 400 error. For example you can not include an `after_id` along with an `archived=false` in the same request. Can be used alongside `metadata` parameter.
