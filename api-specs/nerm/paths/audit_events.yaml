  summary: Query for Audit events
  description: |-
    This endpoint provides a search engine for Audit Events by optionally combining subject_type, type, and subject_id to narrow down the audit events. A Subject Type of Profile links up to the AuditableProfile types. An Subject Type of WorkflowSession links up to the AuditableWorkflow types. An Subject Type of Get/Post/Patch/Delete links up to the AuditableApi types. The remaining Subject Types link up to the ActiveRecord types (configuration changes).
    
    - Any workflow audit event created as of 10/11/2024 will be able to be queried by workflow name, workflow uid, or workflow profile type.
    - Any profile audit event created as of 10/11/2024 will be able to be queried by profile type.
    - The entity_type parameter has been updated to subject_type, which now matches what is in the response object.
    - With the additional query filters added, there is a max of 5 filter parameters at one time (aside from pagination parameters)
    
    To accommodate these changes, an API contract change was required.  Please read the updated API documentation for the new request syntax.
