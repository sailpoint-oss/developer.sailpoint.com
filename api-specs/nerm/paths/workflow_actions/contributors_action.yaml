  operationId: createContributorsAction
  description: Create a contributors action. The following supporting objects will need to be created after this action is created (which are tied together via workflow_action_id) - workflow_action_performers, workflow_action_roles, workflow_action_performer_notification_email. These supporting objects must be created for this action to be complete (APIs for these supporting objects not yet implemented, use UI).
