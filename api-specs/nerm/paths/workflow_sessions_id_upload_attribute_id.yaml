  summary: Uploads workflow session attachment
  operationId: submitWorkflowSessionUpload
  description: >
    Uploads a new attachment attribute value to a workflow session.
    The upload must be a FORM data type; this is not a JSON API.
    The upload must include the binary content of the payload under the 'file' named form element.
    The upload must not attempt to include the file name or its content type as a other form or JSON as parameters.
    The upload must not attempt to upload the file body as the POST body payload; it has to arrive as a FORM parameter.
    Do not use a `File/Binary` payload type for the POST operation in your API client.
