      The ordinal position of the attribute on the Form.  The order value
      determines the order or sequence the Form values are presented in
      the user interface. Each FormAttribute on a Form must have a unique
      order value. Order valuess can start at zero (0), but often start at
      one (1). The FormAttribute with order 1 is presented before the
      FormAttribute with order 2, and so on. Gaps in the order can exist
      and the system ignores them.
