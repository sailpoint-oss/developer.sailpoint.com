Clients who subscribe to an event trigger do not need to initiate a request. They are notified when the event occurs. This is similar to keeping up with the latest world news on the internet.

Event triggers use less bandwidth, they do not affect your API rate limit, and they are as close as you can get to real-time. However, event triggers have downsides to consider.
