Clients who subscribe to an event trigger do not need to initiate a request. They are notified when the event occurs. This is similar to keeping up with the latest world news on the internet. You can initiate the request for data by opening a news website in your browser, or you can subscribe to a mail list to receive the latest news as it happens."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"when-to-use-triggers",children:"When to use triggers"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"It is best to use event triggers when you need to react to an event in real-time.

Event triggers use less bandwidth, they do not affect your API rate limit, and they are as close as you can get to real-time. However, event triggers have downsides to consider.
