In IdentityNow, a source can support various provisioning operations. For example, when a joiner is added to a source, this may trigger both CREATE and UPDATE provisioning operations.  Each usage type is considered a provisioning policy.  A source can have any number of these provisioning policies defined.  These are the common usage types:  CREATE - This usage type relates to \'Create Account Profile\', the provisioning template for the account to be created. For example, this would be used for a joiner on a source.   UPDATE - This usage type relates to \'Update Account Profile\', the provisioning template for the \'Update\' connector operations. For example, this would be used for an attribute sync on a source. ENABLE - This usage type relates to \'Enable Account Profile\', the provisioning template for the account to be enabled. For example, this could be used for a joiner on a source once the joiner\'s account is created.  DISABLE - This usage type relates to \'Disable Account Profile\', the provisioning template for the account to be disabled. For example, this could be used when a leaver is removed temporarily from a source.  You can use these four usage types for all your provisioning policy needs.","permalink":"/docs/tools/sdk/python/v2024/models/usage-type"}],"unlisted":false}}')}}]);
