## Overview

The Identity Security Cloud (ISC) platform is designed for extensibility, which means that it's designed to allow the addition of new capabilities or functionalities. In addition to the APIs, SailPoint provides a number of extensibility options you can use to build custom solutions and integrations that meet your organization's needs.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

## Discuss

The most valuable resource for ISC developers is the SailPoint Developer Community itself, where ISC users and experts all over the world come together to ask questions and provide solutions.

To learn more about ISC extensibility and discuss the different extensibility options with SailPoint Developer Community members, go to the [SailPoint Developer Community Forum](https://developer.sailpoint.com/discuss/c/isc/6).
