        Continuation endpoint for a human parent's
        `nonHumanIdentityOwnership.{category}.primaryOwned.next` or
        `nonHumanIdentityOwnership.{category}.secondaryOwned.next` link. Returns a bare JSON array of
        owned non-human identity summary rows for the given `category`, optional `ownershipRole`,
        `limit`, and `offset`. Wire items match the aggregate ownership item shape
        (`{ id, displayName, source? }`).

        When `ownershipRole` is omitted, the request defaults to `primary`. Pass `count=true` to
        receive `X-Total-Count` (including `0` on empty pages). The `filters` query parameter is not
        supported on this route (HTTP 400).

        Requires tenant licenses `idn:response-and-remediation` and `idn:machine-identity-security`.
        Tenants without `idn:machine-identity-security` receive HTTP 403.

        Not applicable to non-human identities (no ownership slice on the NHI envelope).

            If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

            Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        Personal access tokens are associated with a user in Identity Security Cloud and relies on the user's [user level](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/index.html) (ex. Admin, Helpdesk, etc.) to determine a base level of access.
