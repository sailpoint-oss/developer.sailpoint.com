            Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:

            **scheduleTaskIds**: *eq, in*

            **taskTypeName**: *eq, in*

            **status**: *eq*

            **fullName**: *eq*

            **nameSubString**: *eq*

            **scheduleType**: *eq*

            Supported composite operators are *and, or*

            If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

            Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
