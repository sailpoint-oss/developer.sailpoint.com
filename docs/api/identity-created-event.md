    event:
      description: |-
        This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC) detects a new identity during an aggregation and refresh from an authoritative source. ISC detects a new identity when it finds an account from an authoritative source that isn't correlated to an existing identity.
        This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger.  You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger. For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Identity Created](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/identity-created).

        OAuth2 Bearer token (JWT) generated using either a [personal access token (PAT)](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/authentication/#generate-a-personal-access-token) or through the [authorization code flow](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/authentication/#request-access-token-with-authorization-code-grant-flow).

        Personal access tokens are associated with a user in Identity Security Cloud and relies on the user's [user level](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/index.html) (ex. Admin, Helpdesk, etc.) to determine a base level of access.

        See [Identity Security Cloud REST API Authentication](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/authentication/) for more information.

        Client credentials refers to tokens that are not associated with a user in Identity Security Cloud.
