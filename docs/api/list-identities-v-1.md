            Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:

            **id**: *eq, in*

            **name**: *eq, sw*

            **alias**: *eq, sw*

            **correlated**: *eq*

            Adds additional filter to filters query parameter.

            CORRELATED_ONLY adds correlated=true and returns only identities that are correlated.

            NONE does not add any and returns all identities that satisfy filters query parameter.
          example: NONE

            If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

            Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
