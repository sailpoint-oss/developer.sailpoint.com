            If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.

            Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.

        Personal access tokens are associated with a user in Identity Security Cloud and relies on the user's [user level](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/index.html) (ex. Admin, Helpdesk, etc.) to determine a base level of access.
