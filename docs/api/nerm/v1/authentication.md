## Overview

NERM supports two authentication methods to allow customers to authenticate to NERM API endpoints:

1. **NERM API Key (Legacy)** - NERM-specific bearer tokens
2. **Identity Security Cloud (ISC) API Token (Recommended)** - OAuth 2.0 JWT access tokens from ISC

Both authentication methods use bearer tokens in the request header.

## Authentication Methods

### NERM API Key Authentication

NERM-specific bearer tokens can be generated by following the instructions [here](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/ne-admin/help/setup/api.html).

#### Example

To use your NERM bearer token, provide it in the header with the request:

```bash
curl --location 'https://mycompany.nonemployee.com/api/v1/non-employee-sources' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {nerm_token}'
```

### ISC API Token Authentication

NERM now supports authentication using Identity Security Cloud (ISC) personal access tokens. This allows you to use the same authentication method across both ISC and NERM APIs.

#### Generate a Personal Access Token

A personal access token (PAT) is a method of authenticating to an API as a user without providing a username and password. Any ISC user can generate a PAT by following these steps:

1. Select **Preferences** from the drop-down menu under your username, then **Personal Access Tokens** on the left. You can also go directly to the page by using this URL (replace `[tenant]` with your Identity Security Cloud tenant): `https://[tenant].identitynow.com/ui/d/user-preferences/personal-access-tokens`

2. Click **New Token** and enter a meaningful description to help differentiate the token from others.

:::caution

The **New Token** button will be disabled when you reach the limit of 10 personal access tokens per user. To avoid reaching this limit, it is recommended that you delete any tokens that are no longer necessary.

:::

3. Click **Create Token** to generate and view the two components that comprise the token: the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`.

:::danger Important

After you create the token, the value of the `Client ID` will be visible in the Personal Access Tokens list, but the corresponding `Secret` will not be visible after you close the window. Store the `Secret` somewhere secure.

:::

4. Copy both values somewhere that will be secure and accessible to you when you need to use the token.

#### Request Access Token

Once you have created the PAT, use the client credentials grant flow to obtain a JWT access token:

```bash
curl --location 'https://[tenant].api.identitynow.com/oauth/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id={clientId}' \
--data-urlencode 'client_secret={clientSecret}'
```

The response will contain a JWT access token:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 749,
  "scope": "read write"
}
```

#### Use Access Token with NERM APIs

Include the JWT access token in your NERM API requests:

```bash
curl --location 'https://mycompany.nonemployee.com/api/v1/non-employee-sources' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer {access_token}'
```

The JWT `access_token` grants access matching that of the user who generated the PAT. For example, if the user who generated the PAT is an admin, the returned JWT `access_token` would grant admin access to the NERM APIs.

#### Token Expiration

The `expires_in` value in the token response describes the lifetime, in seconds, of the `access_token`. For example, the value 749 means that the `access_token` will expire in approximately 12.5 minutes from the time the response was generated. When the token expires, you will need to request a new access token using your PAT.
