# Role Propagation

Role Change Propagation ensures that any changes to the composition of a role’s access objects 
(entitlements, access profiles, or dimensions) are applied to all member identities. 
For example: If an entitlement is removed from a role, all identities assigned to that role 
should lose access to that entitlement as part of this process.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
