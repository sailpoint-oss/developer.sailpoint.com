# Search Attribute Configuration

Use this API to implement search attribute configuration functionality, along with [Search](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/search).
With this functionality in place, administrators can create custom search attributes that and run extended searches based on those attributes to further narrow down their searches and get the information and insights they want. 

Identity Security Cloud (ISC) enables organizations to store user data from across all their connected sources and manage the users' access, so the ability to query and filter that data is essential.  
Its search goes through all those sources and finds the results quickly and specifically. 

The search query is flexible - it can be very broad or very narrow. 
The search only returns results for searchable objects it is filtering for. 
The following objects are searchable: identities, roles, access profiles, entitlements, events, and account activities. 
By default, no filter is applied, so a search for "Ad" returns both the identity "Adam.Archer" as well as the role "Administrator."

Users can further narrow their results by using ISC's specific syntax and punctuation to structure their queries. 
For example, the query "attributes.location:austin AND NOT manager.name:amanda.ross" returns all results associated with the Austin location, but it excludes those associated with the manager Amanda Ross.
Refer to [Building a Search Query](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/search/building-query.html) for more information about how to construct specific search queries. 

Refer to [Search Attribute Configuration](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/rules/rule-utility/#configuration-of-search-attributes-within-identity-security-cloud) for more information about ISC's search and its different possibilities. 

With Search Attribute Configuration, administrators can create, manage, and run searches based on the attributes they want to search.
