Use this API to implement saved search functionality. 
With saved search functionality in place, users can save search queries and then view those saved searches, as well as rerun them. 

Search queries in IdentityNow can grow very long and specific, which can make reconstructing them difficult or tedious, so it can be especially helpful to save search queries. 
It also opens the possibility to configure IdentityNow to run the saved queries on a schedule, which is essential to detecting user information and access changes throughout an organization's tenant and across all its sources. 
Refer to [Scheduled Search](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/scheduled-search) for more information about running saved searches on a schedule. 

In IdentityNow, users can save searches under a name, and then they can access that saved search and run it again when they want. 

Refer to [Managing Saved Searches](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/search/saved-searches.html) for more information about saving searches and using them.
