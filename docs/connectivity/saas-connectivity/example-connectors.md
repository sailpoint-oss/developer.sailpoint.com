- [Airtable connector](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/airtable-example-connector) is a real connector that works like a flat file data source and is great for demonstrating how a connector works.

- [Discourse connector](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/discourse-connector-2) is a real connector that works with the [Discourse service](https://www.discourse.org/). The documentation for each command references code from this example application.
