## Overview
Configuration Management provides you with a form of version control for your tenant configurations. 
With Configuration Management, you can export (backup in Configuration Hub) and import (deploy in Configuration Hub) snapshots of your current tenant configurations, downloading them in a JSON. 
These configurations can serve as different versions of your tenant configuration. 
You can then import those configurations into tenants to update, restore, or migrate tenant configurations. 

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
