**Connector-Executed Rules** or **Connector Rules** are rules that are executed in the Identity Security Cloud virtual appliance, and they are usually extensions of the connector itself. The rules are commonly used to perform complex connector-related functions, so they are specific to only certain connectors. Because these rules execute in the virtual appliance, they do not have access to query the Identity Security Cloud data model or fetch information from Identity Security Cloud. They rely instead on contextual information sent from Identity Security Cloud. Connector-executed rules may also have managed connections provided in their contexts to support querying end systems or sources. Though these managed connections may be used, making additional connections or call-outs is not allowed.

Unlike cloud rules, connector rules do not have a rule review process and are directly editable with the [Connector Rule REST APIs](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/connector-rule-management). For more details, see [Configuration Process](#configuration-process).

## Configuration process

Connector Rules are directly editable with the [Connector Rule REST APIs](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/connector-rule-management), which provide ability to interact with rules directly.

| Name | Path |
| --- | --- |
| [List Connector Rules](/docs/api/beta/get-connector-rule-list) | `GET /beta/connector-rules/` |
| [Get Connector Rule](/docs/api/beta/get-connector-rule) | `GET /beta/connector-rules/[id]` |
| [Create Connector Rule](/docs/api/beta/create-connector-rule) | `POST /beta/connector-rules/` |
| [Update Connector Rule](/docs/api/beta/update-connector-rule) | `PUT /beta/connector-rules/[id]` |
| [Delete Connector Rule](/docs/api/beta/delete-connector-rule) | `DELETE /beta/connector-rules/[id]` |
| [Validate Connector Rule](/docs/api/beta/validate-connector-rule) | `POST /beta/connector-rules/validate` |

SailPoint architectural optimizations have added resiliency and protections against malformed or long-running rules. These APIs also offer built-in protection and checking against potentially harmful code. For more information, see [Rule Code Restrictions](../../rules/index.md#rule-code-restrictions).

## Connector Rule object model

```json
{
    "id": "2c91808674a2816a0174af21a6450009",
    "name": "Example WebServices Rule",
    "description": "This is just an example",
    "created": "2020-09-21T05:27:32.170Z",
    "modified": null,
    "type": "WebServiceBeforeOperationRule",
    "signature": {
        "input": [],
        "output": null
    },
    "attributes": {
        "sourceVersion": "2020-09-21 05:27:31"
    },
    "sourceCode": {
        "version": "2020-09-21 05:27:31",
        "script": "\n      import java.util.HashMap;\n      import org.json.JSONArray;\n      import org.json.JSONException;\n      import org.json.JSONObject;\n\n      import org.apache.http.HttpEntity;\n      import org.apache.http.HttpResponse;\n      import org.apache.http.client.HttpClient;\n      import org.apache.http.client.methods.HttpPost;\n      import ...
requestEndPoint.getBody().put(\"jsonBody\",requestXML); \n              }\n        }\n    }\n    log.info(\"Done Ultipro Onboarding before operation rule...\");\n    return requestEndPoint;\n"
    }
}
```

- `id` - Unique UUID that the REST APIs refers to this rule by. This is generated on creation.
- `name` - Name the user interface and references may use to refer to this rule.
- `description` - Description of the rule’s purpose or usage.
- `created` - Timestamp when the rule was created.
- `modified` - Timestamp when the rule was last modified. The default is `null`.
- `type` - Type of connector rule. For a list of supported rule types, see [Supported Connector Rules](#supported-connector-rules).
- `signature` - The list of input variables and the output variable of the rule. These can be found in the corresponding sections of the Rule Documentation. **NOTE**: Adding additional values will not bring in new variables. 
  - `input` - The list of the input variables. This can be found in the Rule documentation's Input section.
  - `output` - The output variable for the rule. This can be found the Rule documentation's Output section.
- `attributes` - List of attributes.
  - `sourceVersion` - String indicating the rule's version. Typically, this is the same as `version`.
- `sourceCode` - Object housing the actual source code that makes the rule work.
  - `version` - String indicating the rule's version. Typically, this is the same as `sourceVersion`.
  - `script` - Rule’s code the connector runs. This must be an escaped string. For help with formatting, use an escaping tool like [Escaping Tool Formatter.](/tools/escaping-tool-formatter)

## Attaching connector-related Rules to sources

Once a connector-related rule has been imported to your tenant, you must configure any sources that need to reference that rule during the desired operation. You can accomplish this configuration through the execution of an API call on the source. The following examples all use a `PATCH` operation for a partial source update, but `PUT` operations work too, as long as the entire source object model is provided.

For the `PATCH` operations, you must provide an `op` key. For new configurations, this key is typically set to `add` as the example shows, but they can be any of the following:

- `add` - Add a new value to the configuration. Use this operation if this is the first time you are setting the value, i.e. it has never been configured before.
- `replace` - Use this operation to change the existing value. Use this operation if you are updating the value, i.e. you want to change the configuration.
- `remove` - Removes a value from the configuration. Use this operation if you want to unset a value. **Caution: Removals can be destructive if the path is improperly configured. This can negatively alter your source config.**

## Example API calls by Rule type

### BeforeProvisioning Rule

`PATCH` /v3/sources/[id]

Content-Type: `application/json-patch+json`

```json
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/beforeProvisioningRule",
    "value": {
      "type": "RULE",
      "id": "2c918085708c274401708c2a8a760001",
      "name": "Example Rule"
    }
  }
]
```

### AfterCreate, AfterModify, AfterDelete, BeforeCreate, BeforeModify, BeforeDelete Rules

`PATCH` /v3/sources/[id]

Content-Type: `application/json-patch+json`

:::info

The value key is a list. All available AfterCreate, AfterModify, BeforeCreate, and BeforeModify rules will need to be set in the same list.

_Note: Replace \[\*\] with the index location of the operation the way it is configured on the source. For example, 0, 1, 2, etc. You can use a`GET`call on the source first to verify the index location prior to executing the `PATCH` call to attach the rule. This number will be 1 less than the value in "sequenceNumberForEndpoint", which is the UI Order value of this endpoint._

```json
[
  {
    "op": "replace",
    "path": "/connectorAttributes/connectionParameters/[*]/beforeRule",
    "value": "Example Rule"
  }
]
```

### WebServiceAfterOperation Rule

`PATCH` /v3/sources/[id] 

Content-Type: `application/json-patch+json`

_Note: Replace \[\*\] with the index location of the operation the way it is configured on the source. For example, 0, 1, 2, etc. You can use a `GET` call on the source first to verify the index location prior to executing the `PATCH` call to attach the rule. This number will be 1 less than the value in "sequenceNumberForEndpoint", which is the UI Order value of this endpoint._
