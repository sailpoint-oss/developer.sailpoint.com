Specifies which months of a schedule are active. Only valid for ANNUALLY schedule types. Examples:

On February and March:
* type LIST
* values "2", "3"

Every 3 months, starting in January (quarterly):
* type LIST
* values "1"
* interval 3

Every two months between July and December:
* type RANGE
* values "7", "12"
* interval 2

Specifies which day(s) a schedule is active for. This is required for all schedule types except DAILY.
The "values" field holds different data depending on the type of schedule:
* WEEKLY: days of the week (1-7)
* MONTHLY: days of the month (1-31, L, L-1...)
* ANNUALLY: if the "months" field is also set: days of the month (1-31, L, L-1...); otherwise: ISO-8601 dates without year ("--12-31")
* CALENDAR: ISO-8601 dates ("2020-12-31")

Note that CALENDAR only supports the LIST type, and ANNUALLY does not support the RANGE type when provided
with ISO-8601 dates without year.

Examples:

On Sundays:
* type LIST
* values "1"

The second to last day of the month:
* type LIST
* values "L-1"

From the 20th to the last day of the month:
* type RANGE
* values "20", "L"

Every March 2nd:
* type LIST
* values "--03-02"

On March 2nd, 2021:
* type: LIST
* values "2021-03-02"
