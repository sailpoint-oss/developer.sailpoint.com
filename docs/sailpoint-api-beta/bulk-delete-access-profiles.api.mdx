## Delete Access Profile(s)



This API initiates a bulk deletion of one or more Access Profiles.

By default, if any of the indicated Access Profiles are in use, no deletions will be performed and the **inUse** field of the response indicates the usages that must be removed first. If the request field **bestEffortOnly** is **true**, however, usages are reported in the **inUse** response field but all other indicated Access Profiles will be deleted.

A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a SOURCE_SUBADMIN may only use this API to delete Access Profiles which are associated with Sources they are able to administer.
