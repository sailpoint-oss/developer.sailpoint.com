## Patch a specified Access Profile



This API updates an existing Access Profile. The following fields are patchable:

**name**, **description**, **enabled**, **owner**, **requestable**, **accessRequestConfig**, **revokeRequestConfig**, **segments**, **entitlements**, **provisioningCriteria**

&gt; You can only add or replace **entitlements** that exist on the source that the access profile is attached to.   You can use the **list entitlements** endpoint with the **filters** query parameter to get a list of available entitlements on the access profile&#39;s source.

&gt;  Patching the value of the **requestable** field is only supported for customers enabled with the new Request  Center. Otherwise, attempting to modify this field results in a 400 error.

A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a SOURCE_SUBADMIN may only use this API to patch Access Profiles which are associated with Sources they are able to administer.
