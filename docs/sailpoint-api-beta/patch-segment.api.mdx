## Update a Segment



Allows updating Segment fields using the [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) standard.

Note that changes to a segment may take some time to propagate to all identities, and that segments will have no effect if segmentation is not enabled for your org.

A token with ORG_ADMIN or API authority is required to call this API.
