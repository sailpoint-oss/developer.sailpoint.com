## Overwrite the preferences for the given notification key.



In the notification world, a notification flows through these salient stages - 
 1. Interest matching, 
 2. Preferences 
 3. Template Rendering. 

The default notification preferences make up a part of the second stage, along with user preferences (which is a future goal). The expectation is for  admins to be able to set default preferences for their org, like opting in to or out of certain notifications, and configuring future preferences as  we tack on more features. The key in the Dto is not necessary but if it is provided and doesn&#39;t match the key in the URI, then a 400 will be thrown. 
Request will require the following legacy roles:  ORG_ADMIN and API
