## List Non-Employee Sources



This gets a list of non-employee sources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are two contextual uses for the requested-for path parameter: &lt;br&gt;
  1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or she may request a list sources assigned to a particular account manager by passing in that manager&#39;s id.&lt;br&gt;
  2. The current user is an account manager, in which case &quot;me&quot; should be provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a list of the sources that he or she owns.
