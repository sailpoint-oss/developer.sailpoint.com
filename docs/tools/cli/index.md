## Start using the CLI

The SailPoint CLI is a terminal-based tool you can use to to interact with your Identity Security Cloud (ISC) tenant. The CLI provides a text-based environment you can use to run operations known as "commands" to interact with your tenant however you want.

You can use the CLI to perform many functions you would have otherwise used Postman or custom scripts to perform before. For example, you can use the CLI to call the SailPoint APIs to do whatever you want in your ISC tenant, and you can do all this directly on the command line, with minimal setup.

## Get the CLI

To install the SailPoint CLI: use a package manager for the OS of your choice. Prebuilt binaries for OS X, Windows, and Linux are provided in each [release](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/sailpoint-cli/releases).

### Windows

:::info

Note this installer is only compatible with 64 bit Windows.

:::

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/sailpoint-cli/releases). The release should include an MSI file named `sail_x.x.x_windows_amd64.msi` that can be installed on Windows, with `x.x.x` being the version of the most recent release.

To install the MSI file, double click on it and follow the prompts in the installer.

### MacOS

MacOS users can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install the CLI. Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
brew tap sailpoint-oss/tap && brew install sailpoint-cli
```

Then make sure you can run the `sail` command.

### Linux

Each release on the [releases page](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/sailpoint-cli/releases) includes a tarball that can be extracted and run on Linux. Or you can install using the available .deb or .rpm packages.

#### Deb package

Download the specific .deb package from the release you wish to install

Then install it using one of the following commands, with the `x.x.x` being the version of the most recent release.

```bash
sudo apt install ./sail_x.x.x_linux_amd64.deb
```

```bash
sudo apt install /path/to/deb/package/sail_x.x.x_linux_amd64.deb
```

#### RPM package

Download the specific .rpm package from the release you wish to install

Then install it using one of the following commands, with the `x.x.x` being the version of the most recent release.

```bash
sudo yum localinstall ./sail_x.x.x_linux_amd64.rpm
```

```bash
sudo yum localinstall /path/to/rpm/package/sail_x.x.x_linux_amd64.rpm
```

## Configuration

To configure the CLI to connect and authenticate to your ISC tenant, you must do the following:

- Find your tenant name. To learn how to find it, refer to [Getting Started](/docs/api/getting-started#find-your-tenant-name). The CLI will use this tenant name to connect to your ISC instance.
- OAuth
- PAT | Create a personal access token (PAT). Make sure to note the "Client ID" and "Client Secret." The CLI needs this information to authenticate successfully. To learn how to create a PAT, refer to [Personal Access Tokens](/docs/api/authentication#generate-a-personal-access-token).

To configure your first environment for OAuth run the following command:

```bash
sail env create {environment}
```

with `{environment}` being the name of the environment you wish to configure.

You will be prompted for the following information:

- The Tenant URL - The web URL used to access your Identity Security Cloud tenant (ex. https://tenant.identitynow.com), this is used during the OAuth process.
- The API URL - The API URL used to access your Identity Security Cloud tenant (ex. https://tenant.api.identitynow.com), this is used for the api calls made by certain commands.

### OAuth authentication

With the default environment values populated you can immediately begin using the CLI with OAuth authentication. Just make sure OAuth is your selected authentication method, this can be done by running `sail set auth oauth`.

### PAT authentication

After you have configured your environment, if you want to use PAT authentication, run the `sail set pat` command. You can then provide your PAT client ID and client secret.

![Configure PAT](https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/sailpoint-cli/blob/main/assets/img/vhs/configure/configure-environment.gif?raw=true)

Once you have provided your client ID and client secret, you can swap your auth method to PAT using `sail set auth pat`.

## Environment variable configuration

You can also store your configuration in environment variables. This can be useful when you are using the CLI in an automated environment like a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. In these types of scenarios, consuming the configuration from environment variables would be easier than creating the configuration file.

To export the environment variables on **Linux/Mac**, open your terminal app and run these commands:

```shell
export SAIL_BASE_URL=https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com
export SAIL_CLIENT_ID={clientID}
export SAIL_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
```

To get your environment variables to persist across terminal sessions, add these exports to your shell profile, something like `~/.bash_profile`.

To store your configuration in environment variables on **Windows**, run Powershell as an administrator and run these commands:

```powershell
$env:SAIL_BASE_URL='https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com'
$env:SAIL_CLIENT_ID='{clientID}'
$env:SAIL_CLIENT_SECRET='{clientSecret}'
```

To get your environment variables to persist across PowerShell sessions, run this command instead:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SAIL_BASE_URL','https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SAIL_CLIENT_ID','{clientID}')
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('SAIL_CLIENT_SECRET','{clientSecret}')
```
