The Python SDK uses data models to structure and manage data within the API. These models provide essential details about the data, including their attributes, data types, and how the models relate to each other. Understanding these models is crucial to effectively interact with the API.

## Key Features
- Attributes: Describe each attribute, including its name, data type, and whether it's required.
- Validation & Constraints: Highlight any rules or limitations for the attributes, such as format or length limits.
- Example: Provides a sample of how the API uses the model.
