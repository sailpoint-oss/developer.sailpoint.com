# ConnectorRuleManagement
  Use this API to implement connector rule management functionality. 
With this functionality in place, administrators can implement connector-executed rules in a programmatic, scalable way. 

In Identity Security Cloud (ISC), [rules](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/rules) serve as a flexible configuration framework you can leverage to perform complex or advanced configurations. 
[Connector-executed rules](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/rules/connector-rules) are rules that are executed in the ISC virtual appliance (VA), usually extensions of the [connector](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/connectors/isc/landingpages/help/landingpages/isc_landing.html) itself, the bridge between the data source and ISC. 
This API allows administrators to view existing connector-executed rules, make changes to them, delete them, and create new ones from the available types.
 
  

All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/beta*
