## get-peer-group-outliers
:::caution deprecated 
This endpoint has been deprecated and may be replaced or removed in future versions of the API.
:::
-- Deprecated : See 'IAI Outliers' This API will be used by Identity Governance systems to identify identities that are not included in an organization's peer groups. By default, 250 identities are returned. You can specify between 1 and 1000 number of identities that can be returned.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-peer-group-outliers)

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | Strategy | **String** | True  | The strategy used to create peer groups. Currently, 'entitlement' is supported.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

### Return type
[**PeerGroupMember[]**](../models/peer-group-member)
