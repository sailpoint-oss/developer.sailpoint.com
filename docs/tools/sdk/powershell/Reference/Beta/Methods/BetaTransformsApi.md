# Transforms
  The purpose of this API is to expose functionality for the manipulation of Transform objects.
Transforms are a form of configurable objects which define an easy way to manipulate attribute data without having
to write code. 

Refer to [Transforms](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/transforms/) for more information about transforms.
 
  

All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/beta*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**New-BetaTransform**](#create-transform) | **POST** `/transforms` | Create transform
[**Remove-BetaTransform**](#delete-transform) | **DELETE** `/transforms/{id}` | Delete a transform
[**Get-BetaTransform**](#get-transform) | **GET** `/transforms/{id}` | Transform by id
[**Get-BetaTransforms**](#list-transforms) | **GET** `/transforms` | List transforms
[**Update-BetaTransform**](#update-transform) | **PUT** `/transforms/{id}` | Update a transform


## create-transform
Creates a new transform object immediately. By default, the internal flag is set to false to indicate that this is a custom transform. Only SailPoint employees have the ability to create a transform with internal set to true. Newly created Transforms can be used in the Identity Profile mappings within the UI. A token with transform write authority is required to call this API.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/create-transform)

------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | Transform | [**Transform**](../models/transform) | True  | The transform to be created.

### Return type

## list-transforms
Gets a list of all saved transform objects.
A token with transforms-list read authority is required to call this API.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/list-transforms)

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Name | **String** |   (optional) | Name of the transform to retrieve from the list.
