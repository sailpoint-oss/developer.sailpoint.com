# Workflows
  Workflows allow administrators to create custom automation scripts directly within Identity Security Cloud.  These automation scripts respond to [event triggers](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/#how-to-get-started-with-event-triggers) and perform a series of actions to perform tasks that are either too cumbersome or not available in the Identity Security Cloud UI.  Workflows can be configured via a graphical user interface within Identity Security Cloud, or by creating and uploading a JSON formatted script to the Workflow service.  The Workflows API collection provides the necessary functionality to create, manage, and test your workflows via REST.

## get-workflow-executions
Use this API to list a specified workflow's executions. Workflow executions are available for up to 90 days before being archived. By default, you can get a maximum of 250 executions.  To get executions past the first 250 records, you can do the following: 
1. Use the [Get Workflows](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/list-workflows) endpoint to get your workflows. 
2. Get your workflow ID from the response. 
3. You can then do either of the following: 

  - Filter to find relevant workflow executions.
  For example, you can filter for failed workflow executions: `GET /workflows/:workflowID/executions?filters=status eq "Failed"`

  - Paginate through results with the `offset` parameter. 
  For example, you can page through 50 executions per page and use that as a way to get to the records past the first 250. 
  Refer to [Paginating Results](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results) for more information about the query parameters you can use to achieve pagination.

## test-workflow
Test a workflow with the provided input data.  The input data should resemble the input that the trigger will send the workflow.

This endpoint will return an execution ID, which can be used to lookup more information about the execution using the `Get a Workflow Execution` endpoint.
**This will cause a live run of the workflow, which could result in unintended modifications to your IDN tenant.**
