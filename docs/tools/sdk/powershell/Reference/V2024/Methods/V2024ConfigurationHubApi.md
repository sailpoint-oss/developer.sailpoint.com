# ConfigurationHub
  Use this API to implement and customize configuration settings management. With this functionality, you can access the Configuration Hub actions and build your own automated pipeline for Identity Security Cloud configuration change delivery and deployment.

Common usages for Configuration Hub includes:

- Upload configuration file - Configuration files can be managed and deployed using Configuration Hub by uploading a JSON file which contains configuration data.
- Manage object mapping - Create rules to map and substitute attributes when migrating configurations.
- Manage backups for configuration settings
- Manage configuration drafts
- Upload configurations and manage object mappings between tenants.

Refer to [Using the SailPoint Configuration Hub](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/confighub/config_hub.html) for more information about Configuration Hub.
