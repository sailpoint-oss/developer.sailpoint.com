## list-outliers-contributing-feature-access-items
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
This API returns a list of the enriched access items associated with each feature filtered by the access item type.

The object contains: accessItemId, display name (translated text or message key), description (translated text or message key), accessType, sourceName, extremelyRare.


[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/list-outliers-contributing-feature-access-items)

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | OutlierId | **String** | True  | The outlier id
Path   | ContributingFeatureName | **String** | True  | The name of contributing feature
   | XSailPointExperimental | **String** | True  (default to "true") | Use this header to enable this experimental API.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | AccessType | **String** |   (optional) | The type of access item for the identity outlier contributing feature. If not provided, it returns all.
  Query | Sorters | **String** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **displayName**
