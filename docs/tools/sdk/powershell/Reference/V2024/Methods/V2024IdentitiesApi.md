# Identities
  Use this API to implement identity functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can synchronize an identity&#39;s attributes with its various source attributes.

Identity Security Cloud uses identities as users&#39; authoritative accounts. Identities can own other accounts, entitlements, and attributes.

An identity has a variety of attributes, such as an account name, an email address, a job title, and more.
These identity attributes can be correlated with different attributes on different sources.
For example, the identity John.Smith can own an account in the GitHub source with the account name John-Smith-Org, and Identity Security Cloud knows they are the same person with the same access and attributes.

In Identity Security Cloud, administrators often set up these synchronizations to get triggered automatically with a change or to run on a schedule.
To manually synchronize attributes for an identity, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu and select Identity List to view the list of identities.
They can then select the identity they want to manually synchronize and use the hamburger menu to select &#39;Synchronize Attributes.&#39;
Doing so immediately begins the attribute synchronization and analyzes all accounts for the selected identity.

Refer to [Synchronizing Attributes](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/attr_sync.html) for more information about synchronizing attributes.

The system will use a combination of [event-based processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#event-based-processing) and [scheduled processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#scheduled-processing) that runs every day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM in the tenant's timezone to keep your identities synchronized. 

This endpoint will perform the following tasks:
1. Calculate identity attributes, including applying or running any rules or transforms (e.g. calculate Lifecycle State at a point-in-time it's expected to change).
2. Evaluate role assignments, leading to assignment of new roles and removal of existing roles.
3. Enforce provisioning for any assigned accesses that haven't been fulfilled (e.g. failure due to source health).
4. Recalculate manager relationships.
5. Potentially clean-up identity processing errors, assuming the error has been resolved.

## synchronize-attributes-for-identity
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
This end-point performs attribute synchronization for a selected identity. The endpoint can be called once in 10 seconds per identity.
