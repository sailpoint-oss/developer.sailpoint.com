### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
   | XSailPointExperimental | **String** | True  (default to "true") | Use this header to enable this experimental API.
  Query | Enabled | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $true) | This boolean indicates whether the segment is currently active. Inactive segments have no effect.
  Query | Unique | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | This returns only one record if set to true and that would be the published record if exists.
  Query | Published | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $true) | This boolean indicates whether the segment is being applied to the accounts. If unpublished its being actively modified until published
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in, sw*  **name**: *eq, in, sw*
