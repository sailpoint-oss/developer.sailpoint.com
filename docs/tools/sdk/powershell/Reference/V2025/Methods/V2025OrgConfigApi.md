### HTTP request headers
- **Content-Type**: Not defined

# Get org config settings

try {
    Get-V2025OrgConfig -XSailPointExperimental $XSailPointExperimental

## get-valid-time-zones
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
List the valid time zones that can be set in organization configurations.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/get-valid-time-zones)

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
   | XSailPointExperimental | **String** | True  (default to "true") | Use this header to enable this experimental API.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 50) | Note that for this API the maximum value for limit is 50. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
