## import-sp-config
This post will import objects from a JSON configuration file into a tenant.
By default, every import will first export all existing objects supported by sp-config as a backup before the import is attempted.
The backup is provided so that the state of the configuration prior to the import is available for inspection or restore if needed.
The backup can be skipped by setting "excludeBackup" to true in the import options.
If a backup is performed, the id of the backup will be provided in the ImportResult as the "exportJobId". This can be downloaded 
using the `/sp-config/export/{exportJobId}/download` endpoint.

You cannot currently import from the Non-Employee Lifecycle Management (NELM) source. You cannot use this endpoint to back up or store NELM data. 

For more information about the object types that currently support import functionality, refer to [SaaS Configuration](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/saas-configuration/#supported-objects).


[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/import-sp-config)

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
   | Data | **System.IO.FileInfo** | True  | JSON file containing the objects to be imported.
  Query | Preview | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | This option is intended to give the user information about how an import operation would proceed, without having any effect on the target tenant. If this parameter is ""true"", no objects will be imported. Instead, the import process will pre-process the import file and attempt to resolve references within imported objects. The import result file will contain messages pertaining to how specific references were resolved, any errors associated with the preprocessing, and messages indicating which objects would be imported. 
   | Options | [**ImportOptions**](../models/import-options) |   (optional) |
