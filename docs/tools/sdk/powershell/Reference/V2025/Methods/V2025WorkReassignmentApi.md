# WorkReassignment
  Use this API to implement work reassignment functionality.

Work Reassignment allows access request reviews, certifications, and manual provisioning tasks assigned to a user to be reassigned to a different user. This is primarily used for:

- Temporarily redirecting work for users who are out of office, such as on vacation or sick leave
- Permanently redirecting work for users who should not be assigned these tasks at all, such as senior executives or service identities

Users can define reassignments for themselves, managers can add them for their team members, and administrators can configure them on any userâ€™s behalf. Work assigned during the specified reassignment timeframes will be automatically reassigned to the designated user as it is created.

Refer to [Work Reassignment](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/users/work_reassignment.html) for more information about this topic.

## get-evaluate-reassignment-configuration
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
Evaluates the Reassignment Configuration for an `Identity` to determine if work items for the specified type should be reassigned. If a valid Reassignment Configuration is found for the identity & work type, then a lookup is initiated which recursively fetches the Reassignment Configuration for the next `TargetIdentity` until no more results are found or a max depth of 5. That lookup trail is provided in the response and the final reassigned identity in the lookup list is returned as the `reassignToId` property. If no Reassignment Configuration is found for the specified identity & config type then the requested Identity ID will be used as the `reassignToId` value and the lookupTrail node will be empty.
