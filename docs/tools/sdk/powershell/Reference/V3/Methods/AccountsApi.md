# Accounts
  Use this API to implement and customize account functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can manage users&#39; access across sources in Identity Security Cloud. 

In Identity Security Cloud, an account refers to a user&#39;s account on a supported source.
This typically includes a unique identifier for the user, a unique password, a set of permissions associated with the source and a set of attributes. Identity Security Cloud loads accounts through the creation of sources in Identity Security Cloud.

Administrators can correlate users&#39; identities with the users&#39; accounts on the different sources they use. 
This allows Identity Security Cloud to govern the access of identities and all their correlated accounts securely and cohesively. 

To view the accounts on a source and their correlated identities, administrators can use the Connections drop-down menu, select Sources, select the relevant source, and select its Account tab. 

To view and edit source account statuses for an identity in Identity Security Cloud, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu, select Identity List, select the relevant identity, and select its Accounts tab. 
Administrators can toggle an account&#39;s Actions to aggregate the account, enable/disable it, unlock it, or remove it from the identity. 

Accounts can have the following statuses: 

- Enabled: The account is enabled. The user can access it.

- Disabled: The account is disabled, and the user cannot access it, but the identity is not disabled in Identity Security Cloud. This can occur when an administrator disables the account or when the user&#39;s lifecycle state changes. 

- Locked: The account is locked. This may occur when someone has entered an incorrect password for the account too many times.

- Pending: The account is currently updating. This status typically lasts seconds. 

Administrators can select the source account to view its attributes, entitlements, and the last time the account&#39;s password was changed.

Refer to [Managing User Accounts](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/) for more information about accounts.

## create-account
Submit an account creation task - the API then returns the task ID.  

You must include the `sourceId` where the account will be created in the `attributes` object.

This endpoint creates an account on the source record in your ISC tenant.
This is useful for Flat File (`DelimitedFile`) type sources because it allows you to aggregate new accounts without needing to import a new CSV file every time. 

However, if you use this endpoint to create an account for a Direct Connection type source, you must ensure that the account also exists on the target source. 
The endpoint doesn't actually provision the account on the target source, which means that if the account doesn't also exist on the target source, an aggregation between the source and your tenant will remove it from your tenant. 

By providing the account ID of an existing account in the request body, this API will function as a PATCH operation and update the account.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | AccountAttributesCreate | [**AccountAttributesCreate**](../models/account-attributes-create) | True  | 

### Return type
[**AccountsAsyncResult**](../models/accounts-async-result)

### Responses
Code | Description  | Data Type
------------- | ------------- | -------------
202 | Async task details. | AccountsAsyncResult
400 | Client Error - Returned if the request body is invalid. | ErrorResponseDto
401 | Unauthorized - Returned if there is no authorization header, or if the JWT token is expired. | ListAccessProfiles401Response
403 | Forbidden - Returned if the user you are running as, doesn&#39;t have access to this end-point. | ErrorResponseDto
429 | Too Many Requests - Returned in response to too many requests in a given period of time - rate limited. The Retry-After header in the response includes how long to wait before trying again. | ListAccessProfiles429Response
500 | Internal Server Error - Returned if there is an unexpected error. | ErrorResponseDto

### HTTP request headers
- **Content-Type**: application/json
- **Accept**: application/json

### Example
```powershell
$AccountAttributesCreate = @"{
  "attributes" : {
    "sourceId" : "34bfcbe116c9407464af37acbaf7a4dc",
    "city" : "Austin",
    "displayName" : "John Doe",

```

## delete-account
Use this API to delete an account. 
This endpoint submits an account delete task and returns the task ID. 
This endpoint only deletes the account from IdentityNow, not the source itself, which can result in the account's returning with the next aggregation between the source and IdentityNow.  To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that you [disable accounts](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/disable-account) rather than delete them. This will also allow you to reenable the accounts in the future. 
>**NOTE: You can only delete accounts from sources of the "DelimitedFile" type.**

## update-account
Use this API to update account details. 

This API supports updating an account's correlation by modifying the `identityId` and `manuallyCorrelated` fields. 
To reassign an account from one identity to another, replace the current `identityId` with a new value. 
If the account you're assigning was provisioned by Identity Security Cloud (ISC), it's possible for ISC to create a new account 
for the previous identity as soon as the account is moved. If the account you're assigning is authoritative, 
this causes the previous identity to become uncorrelated and can even result in its deletion.
All accounts that are reassigned will be set to `manuallyCorrelated: true` unless you specify otherwise.

>**Note:** The `attributes` field can only be modified for flat file accounts.
