## create-provisioning-policy


This API generates a create policy/template based on field value transforms. This API is intended for use when setting up JDBC Provisioning type sources, but it will also work on other source types.
Transforms can be used in the provisioning policy to create a new attribute that you only need during provisioning.
Refer to [Transforms in Provisioning Policies](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/transforms/guides/transforms-in-provisioning-policies) for more information.
A token with ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.

## create-source


This creates a specific source with a full source JSON representation. Any passwords are submitted as plain-text and encrypted upon receipt in IdentityNow.
A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
 Body  | Source | [**Source**](../models/source) | True  | 
  Query | ProvisionAsCsv | **Boolean** |   (optional) | If this parameter is `true`, it configures the source as a Delimited File (CSV) source. Setting this to `true` will automatically set the `type` of the source to `DelimitedFile`.  You must use this query parameter to create a Delimited File source as you would in the UI.  If you don't set this query parameter and you attempt to set the `type` attribute directly, the request won't correctly generate the source.  

	
### Return type

[**Source**](../models/source)

### Responses
Code | Description  | Data Type
------------- | ------------- | -------------
201 | Created Source object. Any passwords will only show the the encrypted cipher-text, as they are not decrypt-able in IdentityNow cloud-based services, per IdentityNow security design. | Source

## delete-provisioning-policy


Deletes the provisioning policy with the specified usage on an application.
A token with API, or ORG_ADMIN authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | SourceId | **String** | True  | The Source ID.
Path   | UsageType | [**UsageType**](../models/usage-type) | True  | The type of provisioning policy usage.  In IdentityNow, a source can support various provisioning operations. For example, when a joiner is added to a source, this may trigger both CREATE and UPDATE provisioning operations.  Each usage type is considered a provisioning policy.  A source can have any number of these provisioning policies defined.  These are the common usage types:  CREATE - This usage type relates to 'Create Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be created. For example, this would be used for a joiner on a source.   UPDATE - This usage type relates to 'Update Account Profile', the provisioning template for the 'Update' connector operations. For example, this would be used for an attribute sync on a source. ENABLE - This usage type relates to 'Enable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be enabled. For example, this could be used for a joiner on a source once the joiner's account is created.  DISABLE - This usage type relates to 'Disable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be disabled. For example, this could be used when a leaver is removed temporarily from a source.  You can use these four usage types for all your provisioning policy needs.

## list-sources


This end-point lists all the sources in IdentityNow.
A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, SOURCE_SUBADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in, ge, gt, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **name**: *co, eq, in, sw, ge, gt, ne, isnull*  **type**: *eq, in, ge, gt, ne, isnull, sw*  **owner.id**: *eq, in, ge, gt, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **features**: *ca, co*  **created**: *eq, ge, gt, in, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **modified**: *eq, ge, gt, in, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **managementWorkgroup.id**: *eq, ge, gt, in, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **description**: *eq, sw*  **authoritative**: *eq, ne, isnull*  **healthy**: *isnull*  **status**: *eq, in, ge, gt, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **connectionType**: *eq, ge, gt, in, le, lt, ne, isnull, sw*  **connectorName**: *eq, ge, gt, in, ne, isnull, sw*
  Query | Sorters | **String** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **type, created, modified, name, owner.name, healthy, status, id, description, owner.id, accountCorrelationConfig.id, accountCorrelationConfig.name, managerCorrelationRule.type, managerCorrelationRule.id, managerCorrelationRule.name, authoritative, managementWorkgroup.id, connectorName, connectionType**
  Query | ForSubadmin | **String** |   (optional) | Filter the returned list of sources for the identity specified by the parameter, which is the id of an identity with the role SOURCE_SUBADMIN. By convention, the value **me** indicates the identity id of the current user. Subadmins may only view Sources which they are able to administer; all other Sources will be filtered out when this parameter is set. If the current user is a SOURCE_SUBADMIN but fails to pass a valid value for this parameter, a 403 Forbidden is returned.

## put-provisioning-policy


This end-point updates the provisioning policy with the specified usage on the specified source in IdentityNow.
Transforms can be used in the provisioning policy to create a new attribute that you only need during provisioning.
Refer to [Transforms in Provisioning Policies](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/transforms/guides/transforms-in-provisioning-policies) for more information.
A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | SourceId | **String** | True  | The Source ID.
Path   | UsageType | [**UsageType**](../models/usage-type) | True  | The type of provisioning policy usage.  In IdentityNow, a source can support various provisioning operations. For example, when a joiner is added to a source, this may trigger both CREATE and UPDATE provisioning operations.  Each usage type is considered a provisioning policy.  A source can have any number of these provisioning policies defined.  These are the common usage types:  CREATE - This usage type relates to 'Create Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be created. For example, this would be used for a joiner on a source.   UPDATE - This usage type relates to 'Update Account Profile', the provisioning template for the 'Update' connector operations. For example, this would be used for an attribute sync on a source. ENABLE - This usage type relates to 'Enable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be enabled. For example, this could be used for a joiner on a source once the joiner's account is created.  DISABLE - This usage type relates to 'Disable Account Profile', the provisioning template for the account to be disabled. For example, this could be used when a leaver is removed temporarily from a source.  You can use these four usage types for all your provisioning policy needs.

## update-source-schema


Use this API to selectively update an existing Schema using a JSONPatch payload. 

The following schema fields are immutable and cannot be updated:

- id
- name
- created
- modified


To switch an account attribute to a group entitlement, you need to have the following in place:

- `isEntitlement: true`
- Must define a schema for the group and [add it to the source](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/create-source-schema) before updating the `isGroup` flag.  For example, here is the `group` account attribute referencing a schema that defines the group:
```json
{
    "name": "groups",
    "type": "STRING",
    "schema": {
        "type": "CONNECTOR_SCHEMA",
        "id": "2c9180887671ff8c01767b4671fc7d60",
        "name": "group"
    },
    "description": "The groups, roles etc. that reference account group objects",
    "isMulti": true,
    "isEntitlement": true,
    "isGroup": true
}
```


### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | SourceId | **String** | True  | The Source id.
