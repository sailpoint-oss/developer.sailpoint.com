## list-account-activities

This gets a collection of account activities that satisfy the given query parameters.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description

  Query | RequestedFor | **String** |   (optional) | The identity that the activity was requested for. *me* indicates the current user. Mutually exclusive with *regarding-identity*.
  Query | RequestedBy | **String** |   (optional) | The identity that requested the activity. *me* indicates the current user. Mutually exclusive with *regarding-identity*.
  Query | RegardingIdentity | **String** |   (optional) | The specified identity will be either the requester or target of the account activity. *me* indicates the current user. Mutually exclusive with *requested-for* and *requested-by*.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
