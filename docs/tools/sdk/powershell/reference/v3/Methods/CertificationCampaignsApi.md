## get-active-campaigns

Use this API to get a list of campaigns. This API can provide increased level of detail for each campaign for the correct provided query.


### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | Detail | **String** |   (optional) | Determines whether slim, or increased level of detail is provided for each campaign in the returned list. Slim is the default behavior.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

## start-generate-campaign-template

Use this API to generate a new certification campaign from a campaign template.

The campaign object contained in the template has special formatting applied to its name and description
fields that determine the generated campaign's name/description. Placeholders in those fields are
formatted with the current date and time upon generation.

Placeholders consist of a percent sign followed by a letter indicating what should be inserted. For
example, "%Y" inserts the current year, and a campaign template named "Campaign for %y" generates a
campaign called "Campaign for 2020" (assuming the year at generation time is 2020).

Valid placeholders are the date/time conversion suffix characters supported by [java.util.Formatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html).


### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | Id | **String** | True  | ID of the campaign template to use for generation.

### Return type

[**CampaignReference**](../models/campaign-reference)
