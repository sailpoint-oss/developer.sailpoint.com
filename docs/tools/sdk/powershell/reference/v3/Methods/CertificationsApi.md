## get-identity-certification-item-permissions

This API returns the permissions associated with an entitlement certification item based on the certification item's ID. Reviewers for this certification can also call this API.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | CertificationId | **String** | True  | The certification ID
Path   | ItemId | **String** | True  | The certification item ID
  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **target**: *eq, sw*  **rights**: *ca*  Supported composite operators: *and, or*  All field values (second filter operands) are case-insensitive for this API.  Only a single *and* or *or* composite filter operator may be used. It must also be used between a target filter and a rights filter, not between 2 filters for the same field.  For example, the following is valid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+target+eq+%22SYS.OBJAUTH2%22`  The following is invalid: 1?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+rights+ca+(%SELECT%22)1
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

## list-identity-certifications

Use this API to get a list of identity campaign certifications for the specified query parameters. Any authenticated token can call this API, but only certifications you are authorized to review will be returned. This API does not support requests for certifications assigned to governance groups.

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | ReviewerIdentity | **String** |   (optional) | Reviewer's identity. *me* indicates the current user.
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **campaign.id**: *eq, in*  **phase**: *eq*  **completed**: *eq*
  Query | Sorters | **String** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name, due, signed**
