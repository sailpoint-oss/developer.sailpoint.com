Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**Get-PublicIdentities**](#get-public-identities) | **GET** `/public-identities` | Get list of public identities

### Parameters 
Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | Limit | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Offset | **Int32** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Count | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | Filters | **String** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **alias**: *eq, sw*  **email**: *eq, sw*  **firstname**: *eq, sw*  **lastname**: *eq, sw*
  Query | AddCoreFilters | **Boolean** |   (optional) (default to $false) | If *true*, only get identities which satisfy ALL the following criteria in addition to any criteria specified by *filters*:   - Should be either correlated or protected.   - Should not be ""spadmin"" or ""cloudadmin"".   - uid should not be null.   - lastname should not be null.   - email should not be null.
  Query | Sorters | **String** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name**
