# sailpoint.beta.ApprovalsApi
  Use this API to implement approval functionality. With this functionality in place, you can get generic approvals and modify them. 

The main advantages this API has vs [Access Request Approvals](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/access-request-approvals) are that you can use it to get generic approvals individually or in batches and make changes to those approvals.
 
All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/beta*
