# sailpoint.beta.CertificationsApi
  Use this API to implement certification functionality.
This API provides specific functionality that improves an organization&#39;s ability to manage its certification process.

A certification refers to Identity Security Cloud&#39;s mechanism for reviewing a user&#39;s access to entitlements (sets of permissions) and approving or removing that access.
These certifications serve as a way of showing that a user&#39;s access has been reviewed and approved.
Multiple certifications by different reviewers are often required to approve a user&#39;s access.
A set of multiple certifications is called a certification campaign.

For example, an organization may use a Manager Certification as a way of showing that a user&#39;s access has been reviewed and approved by their manager, or if the certification is part of a campaign, that the user&#39;s access has been reviewed and approved by multiple managers.
Once this certification has been completed, Identity Security Cloud  would provision all the access the user needs, nothing more.

This API enables administrators and reviewers to get useful information about certifications at a high level, such as the reviewers involved, and at a more granular level, such as the permissions affected by changes to entitlements within those certifications.
It also provides the useful ability to reassign identities and items within certifications to other reviewers, rather than [reassigning the entire certifications themselves](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/submit-reassign-certs-async/).

Refer to [Managing User Accounts](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/user_access.html#managing-user-accounts) for more information about accounts.

## get-identity-certification-item-permissions
:::caution deprecated 
This endpoint has been deprecated and may be replaced or removed in future versions of the API.
:::
Permissions for entitlement certification item
This API returns the permissions associated with an entitlement certification item based on the certification item's ID. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is required to call this API. Reviewers for this certification can also call this API.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-identity-certification-item-permissions)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
Path   | certification_id | **str** | True  | The certification ID
Path   | item_id | **str** | True  | The certification item ID
  Query | filters | **str** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **target**: *eq, sw*  **rights**: *ca*  All field values (second filter operands) are case-insensitive for this API.  Only a single *and* or *or* composite filter operator may be used. It must also be used between a target filter and a rights filter, not between 2 filters for the same field.  For example, the following is valid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+target+eq+%22SYS.OBJAUTH2%22`  The following is invalid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+rights+ca+(%SELECT%22)`
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

## submit-reassign-certs-async
:::caution deprecated 
This endpoint has been deprecated and may be replaced or removed in future versions of the API.
:::
Reassign certifications asynchronously
This API initiates a task to reassign up to 500 identities or items in an identity campaign certification to another reviewer. The `certification-tasks` API can be used to get an updated status on the task and determine when the reassignment is complete. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is required to call this API. Reviewers for this certification can also call this API.
