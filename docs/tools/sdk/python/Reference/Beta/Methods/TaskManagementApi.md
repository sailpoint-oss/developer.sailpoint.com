Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**get-pending-task-headers**](#get-pending-task-headers) | **HEAD** `/task-status/pending-tasks` | Retrieve pending task list headers
[**get-pending-tasks**](#get-pending-tasks) | **GET** `/task-status/pending-tasks` | Retrieve pending task status list
[**get-task-status**](#get-task-status) | **GET** `/task-status/{id}` | Get task status by id
[**get-task-status-list**](#get-task-status-list) | **GET** `/task-status` | Retrieve task status list
[**update-task-status**](#update-task-status) | **PATCH** `/task-status/{id}` | Update task status by id


## get-pending-task-headers
Retrieve pending task list headers
Responds with headers only for list of task statuses for pending tasks.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-pending-task-headers)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
