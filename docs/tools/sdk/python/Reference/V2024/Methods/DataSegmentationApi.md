  Query | enabled | **bool** |   (optional) (default to True) | This boolean indicates whether the segment is currently active. Inactive segments have no effect.
  Query | unique | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | This returns only one record if set to true and that would be the published record if exists.
  Query | published | **bool** |   (optional) (default to True) | This boolean indicates whether the segment is being applied to the accounts. If unpublished its being actively modified until published
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | filters | **str** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in, sw*  **name**: *eq, in, sw*

## publish-data-segment
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
:::tip setting x-sailpoint-experimental header
 on the configuration object you can set the `x-sailpoint-experimental` header to `true' to enable all experimantl endpoints within the SDK.
 Example:
 ```python
   configuration = Configuration()
   configuration.experimental = True
 ```
:::
Publish segment by id
This will publish the segment so that it starts applying the segmentation to the desired users if enabled

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/publish-data-segment)
