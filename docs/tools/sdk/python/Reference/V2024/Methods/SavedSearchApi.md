# sailpoint.v2024.SavedSearchApi
  Use this API to implement saved search functionality. 
With saved search functionality in place, users can save search queries and then view those saved searches, as well as rerun them. 

Search queries in Identity Security Cloud can grow very long and specific, which can make reconstructing them difficult or tedious, so it can be especially helpful to save search queries. 
It also opens the possibility to configure Identity Security Cloud to run the saved queries on a schedule, which is essential to detecting user information and access changes throughout an organization&#39;s tenant and across all its sources. 
Refer to [Scheduled Search](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/scheduled-search/) for more information about running saved searches on a schedule. 

In Identity Security Cloud, users can save searches under a name, and then they can access that saved search and run it again when they want. 

Refer to [Managing Saved Searches](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/search/saved-searches.html) for more information about saving searches and using them.
 
All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v2024*

## list-saved-searches
A list of saved searches
Returns a list of saved searches.


[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/list-saved-searches)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | filters | **str** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **owner.id**: *eq*
