# sailpoint.v2024.TransformsApi
  The purpose of this API is to expose functionality for the manipulation of Transform objects.
Transforms are a form of configurable objects which define an easy way to manipulate attribute data without having
to write code. 

Refer to [Transforms](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/transforms/) for more information about transforms.
 
All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v2024*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**create-transform**](#create-transform) | **POST** `/transforms` | Create transform
[**delete-transform**](#delete-transform) | **DELETE** `/transforms/{id}` | Delete a transform
[**get-transform**](#get-transform) | **GET** `/transforms/{id}` | Transform by id
[**list-transforms**](#list-transforms) | **GET** `/transforms` | List transforms
[**update-transform**](#update-transform) | **PUT** `/transforms/{id}` | Update a transform


## create-transform
Create transform
Creates a new transform object immediately. By default, the internal flag is set to false to indicate that this is a custom transform. Only SailPoint employees have the ability to create a transform with internal set to true. Newly created Transforms can be used in the Identity Profile mappings within the UI.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/create-transform)

## list-transforms
List transforms
Gets a list of all saved transform objects.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/list-transforms)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.
