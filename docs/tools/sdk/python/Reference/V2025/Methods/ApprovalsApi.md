# sailpoint.v2025.ApprovalsApi
  Use this API to implement approval functionality. With this functionality in place, you can get generic approvals and modify them. 

The main advantages this API has vs [Access Request Approvals](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/access-request-approvals) are that you can use it to get generic approvals individually or in batches and make changes to those approvals. 
 
All URIs are relative to *https://sailpoint.api.identitynow.com/v2025*

Method | HTTP request | Description
------------- | ------------- | -------------
[**get-approval**](#get-approval) | **GET** `/generic-approvals/{id}` | Get an approval
[**get-approvals**](#get-approvals) | **GET** `/generic-approvals` | Get approvals


## get-approval
:::warning experimental 
This API is currently in an experimental state. The API is subject to change based on feedback and further testing. You must include the X-SailPoint-Experimental header and set it to `true` to use this endpoint.
:::
:::tip setting x-sailpoint-experimental header
 on the configuration object you can set the `x-sailpoint-experimental` header to `true' to enable all experimantl endpoints within the SDK.
 Example:
 ```python
   configuration = Configuration()
   configuration.experimental = True
 ```
:::
Get an approval
Retrieve a single approval for a given approval ID. This endpoint is for generic approvals, different than the access-request-approval endpoint and does not include access-request-approvals.

Get approvals
Retrieve a list of approvals, which can be filtered by requester ID, status, or reference type. "Mine" query parameter can be used and it will return all approvals for the current approver. This endpoint is for generic approvals, different than the access-request-approval endpoint and does not include access-request-approvals. 
Absence of all query parameters will will default to mine=true.
