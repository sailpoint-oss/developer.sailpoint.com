# sailpoint.v2025.IdentitiesApi
  Use this API to implement identity functionality.
With this functionality in place, administrators can synchronize an identity&#39;s attributes with its various source attributes.

Identity Security Cloud uses identities as users&#39; authoritative accounts. Identities can own other accounts, entitlements, and attributes.

An identity has a variety of attributes, such as an account name, an email address, a job title, and more.
These identity attributes can be correlated with different attributes on different sources.
For example, the identity John.Smith can own an account in the GitHub source with the account name John-Smith-Org, and Identity Security Cloud knows they are the same person with the same access and attributes.

In Identity Security Cloud, administrators often set up these synchronizations to get triggered automatically with a change or to run on a schedule.
To manually synchronize attributes for an identity, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu and select Identity List to view the list of identities.
They can then select the identity they want to manually synchronize and use the hamburger menu to select &#39;Synchronize Attributes.&#39;
Doing so immediately begins the attribute synchronization and analyzes all accounts for the selected identity.

Refer to [Synchronizing Attributes](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/attr_sync.html) for more information about synchronizing attributes.

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

  Query | filters | **str** |   (optional) | Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)  Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:  **id**: *eq, in*  **name**: *eq, sw*  **alias**: *eq, sw*  **firstname**: *eq, sw*  **lastname**: *eq, sw*  **email**: *eq, sw*  **cloudStatus**: *eq*  **processingState**: *eq*  **correlated**: *eq*  **protected**: *eq*
  Query | sorters | **str** |   (optional) | Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)  Sorting is supported for the following fields: **name, alias, cloudStatus**
  Query | default_filter | **str** |   (optional) (default to CORRELATED_ONLY) | Adds additional filter to filters query parameter.  CORRELATED_ONLY adds correlated=true and returns only identities that are correlated.  NONE does not add any and returns all identities that satisfy filters query parameter.
  Query | count | **bool** |   (optional) (default to False) | If *true* it will populate the *X-Total-Count* response header with the number of results that would be returned if *limit* and *offset* were ignored.  Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send **count=true** if that value will not be used.  See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | limit | **int** |   (optional) (default to 250) | Max number of results to return. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.

 Example:

:::
Process a list of identityids
This operation should not be used to schedule your own identity processing or to perform system wide identity refreshes. The system will use a combination of [event-based processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#event-based-processing) and [scheduled processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#scheduled-processing) that runs every day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM in the tenant's timezone to keep your identities synchronized. 

This endpoint will perform the following tasks:
1. Calculate identity attributes, including applying or running any rules or transforms (e.g. calculate Lifecycle State at a point-in-time it's expected to change).
2. Evaluate role assignments, leading to assignment of new roles and removal of existing roles.
3. Enforce provisioning for any assigned accesses that haven't been fulfilled (e.g. failure due to source health).
4. Recalculate manager relationships.
5. Potentially clean-up identity processing errors, assuming the error has been resolved.
