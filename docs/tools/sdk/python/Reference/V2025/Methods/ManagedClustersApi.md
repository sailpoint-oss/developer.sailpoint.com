## get-managed-clusters
Get managed clusters
List current organization's managed clusters, based on request context.

[API Spec](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/get-managed-clusters)

### Parameters 

Param Type | Name | Data Type | Required  | Description
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- 
  Query | offset | **int** |   (optional) (default to 0) | Offset into the full result set. Usually specified with *limit* to paginate through the results. See [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters) for more information.
