The TypeScript SDK uses the Axios library to handle HTTP requests. Axios will throw an error for any response status that falls outside the range of 2xx. A non-2xx response will immediately halt the program and produce a stack trace. Axios provides two methods for gracefully handling error responses from an API.

The first method is to use a `catch` function to intercept any unsuccessful response and take actions on the results, such as logging the message or performing additional actions before exiting the program:

```typescript showLineNumbers
// Catch any non 2xx response and log the error message and metadata
let transforms = await api.listTransforms().catch(function (error) {
  console.log(error.response.data);
  console.log(error.response.status);
  console.log(error.response.headers);
});
```

The second method is to define which HTTP status codes should throw an error for a given request using the `validateStatus` option. This gives you an opportunity to recover from a bad request without exiting the program.

If you don't want the program to exit for 4xx response codes, you can use this configuration:

```typescript showLineNumbers
// Resolve only if the status code is less than 500
let transforms = await api.listTransforms(
  {filters: 'id eq'},
  {
    validateStatus: function (status) {
      return status < 500;
    },
  },
);

if (transforms.status === 200) {
  console.log(transforms);
} else if (transforms.status === 400) {
  console.log('The filter is invalid.  Continuing execution.');
}
```

If you don't want the program to exit for any error response, you can use this configuration:

```typescript
await api.listTransforms(
  {},
  {
    validateStatus: function (status) {
      return true;
    },
  },
);
```
