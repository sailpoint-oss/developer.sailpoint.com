You can use the SDK to create new resources.

For example, you can run a script to create a work group, also known as a [governance group](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/governance_groups.html). 

Copy this 'create WorkGroup' script from the beta APIs into your Python project to try it out:

```python showLineNumbers
import sailpoint
import sailpoint.v3
import sailpoint.beta
from sailpoint.beta.models.workgroup_dto import WorkgroupDto
from sailpoint.beta.models.owner_dto import OwnerDto
from sailpoint.configuration import Configuration

configuration = Configuration()

api_client = sailpoint.v3.ApiClient(configuration)
api_client_beta = sailpoint.beta.ApiClient(configuration)

identities_api_instance = sailpoint.v3.PublicIdentitiesApi(api_client)
workgroups_api_instance = sailpoint.beta.GovernanceGroupsApi(api_client_beta)

identity = identities_api_instance.get_public_identities(limit=1)[0]

workgroup = WorkgroupDto(name='DB Access Governance Group', 
                         description='Description of the Governance Group', 
                         owner=OwnerDto(id=identity.id, 
                                        name=identity.name, 
                                        type='IDENTITY'))


try:
    workgroupResponse = workgroups_api_instance.create_workgroup(workgroup)
    print("The response of GovernanceGroupsApi->create_workgroup:\n")
    print(workgroupResponse)
except Exception as e:
    print("Exception when calling GovernanceGroupsApi->create_workgroup: %s\n" % e)
```

Run this command to run the code:

```bash
python sdk.py
```

The example uses the `getPublicIdentities` method from the `PublicIdentitiesApi` to pull an identity needed to be the owner of the work group.

The `create_workgroup` request is initialized on lines 18-22, using the identity's `name` and `id` in the owner object.

The SDK will return the created work group:

```bash
id='d287a1e2-81fc-474e-bc0c-155bd8ab0899' 
name='DB Access Governance Group' 
description='Description of the Governance Group' 
member_count=0 
connection_count=0
owner=OwnerDto(type='IDENTITY', 
               id='0003c25c365e492381d4e557b6159f9b', 
               name='Brian Mendoza')
```
