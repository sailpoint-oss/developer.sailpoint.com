# Transforms

The `transforms` command makes it easy to create, manage, and test transforms. Please [read our transforms guide](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/docs/transforms) for more information about transforms.

## List transforms

Run the following command to get a list of transforms available in your tenant.

```shell
sail transform list
```

This will produce a table of the available transforms.

## Download transforms

Run the following command to download all of the transforms in your tenant and save them as `json` files on your computer. By default, this command will save the files in the current working directory. Use the `-d` flag to specify a path to an output directory.

```shell
sail transform download -d transform_files
```

<img src="./../../assets/img/vhs/transform/transform-download.gif" alt="transform download">

This command will overwrite any existing files with the same name, so take care when running this in a directory that has modified transforms that have not yet been saved.

## Create transform

Run the following command to create a new transform from a `json` file. Use the `-f` flag to specify the path to the `json` file.

```shell
sail transform create -f transform.json
```

## Update transform

Run the following command to update a transform from a `json` file. Use the `-f` flag to specify the path to the `json` file.

```shell
sail transform update -f transform.json
```

A common workflow is to download the transforms first, make edits to the transform file, and then use the update command to save those edits in IdentityNow.

## Preview transform

The preview command will show you the final output a transform using real account data from IdentityNow. This command is safe to use when testing as it will not modify account or identity details in IdentityNow.

### Explicit input

Transforms that have **explicit input** will reference the account attribute to pull data from directly in the transform specification. The following flags are required to run this command.

- `-i` The ID of the identity profile to use for the preview. You can find the ID of the identity profile you are interested in by using the [get identity profiles API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-identity-profiles).
- `-a` The name of the identity attribute to apply the transform to. This will depend on the attributes available in the identity profile.

Run the following command to preview an **explicit input** transform.

```shell
sail transform preview -i 2c91808876628b6201767b4bfea61dbb -a department -f transform.json
```

### Implicit input

Transforms that use **implicit input** will rely on the identity profile mapping in IdentityNow to determine which account attribute will be used in the transform. These transforms require additional flags.

- `--implicit` indicates that the transform to preview uses implicit input. It does not specify an account attribute directly in the JSON.
- `-n <transform-name>` The name of the transform. The transform must be saved in IdentityNow before running this command.

```shell
sail transform preview -i 2c91808876628b6201767b4bfea61dbb -a department -n ToUpper --implicit
```

### Output

The preview command will produce the following output.

```shell
Original value: adam.archer
Transformed value: ADAM.ARCHER
```

The `Original value` is the value of the identity attribute as of the last identity refresh. It is **NOT** the value of the account attribute as it exists on the source. This value may already have been transformed if the identity profile mapping has a transform mapped to the attribute.

The `Transformed value` is a result of the account attribute from the source being changed according to the transform specification. It is what the identity attribute will become if this transform is used in the identity profile.

## Delete transform

To delete a single transform, run the following command.

```shell
sail transform delete <transform-id>
```

To delete a multiple transforms, use the following syntax.

```shell
sail transform delete <transform-id> <transform-id> <transform-id>
```

This command is commonly used in conjuction with the `ls` command to find the ID of the transform you wish to delete.

```shell
sail transform list
