  summary: Delete Access Profile(s)
  tags:
    - Access Profiles
  description: >-
    This endpoint initiates a bulk deletion of one or more access profiles.

    When the request is successful, the endpoint returns the bulk delete's task result ID. 
    To follow the task, you can use [Get Task Status by ID](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/get-task-status), which will return the task result's status and information. 

    This endpoint can only bulk delete up to a limit of 50 access profiles per request. 

    By default, if any of the indicated access profiles are in use, no deletions will be performed and the **inUse**
    field of the response indicates the usages that must be removed first. If the request field **bestEffortOnly** is
    **true**, however, usages are reported in the **inUse** response field but all other indicated access profiles will
    be deleted.
