    This updates account details.
    A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

    This endpoint supports updating an account's correlation. The identityId and manuallyCorrelated fields can be
    modified for any account. The attributes fields can be modified just for flat file accounts. 
    To re-assign an account from one identity to another, replace the current identityId with a new value. 
    If the account you're assigning was provisioned by IdentityNow, it's possible IdentityNow could create a new account 
    for the previous identity as soon as the account is moved. If the account you're assigning is authoritative, 
    this will cause the previous identity to become uncorrelated and could even result in its deletion.
    All accounts that are reassigned will be set to manuallyCorrelated: true unless otherwise specified

  summary: Delete Account
  description: >-
    Use this API to delete an account. 

    This endpoint submits an account delete task and returns the task ID. 

    This endpoint only deletes the account from IdentityNow, not the source itself, which can result in the account's returning with the next aggregation between the source and IdentityNow. 
    To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that you [disable accounts](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/disable-account) rather than delete them. This will also allow you to reenable the accounts in the future. 

    A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

    >**NOTE:** You can only delete accounts from sources of the "DelimitedFile" type.**
