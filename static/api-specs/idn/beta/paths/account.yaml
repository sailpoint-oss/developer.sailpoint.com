  description: |
    Use this API to update account details. 
    A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

    This API supports updating an account's correlation by modifying the `identityId` and `manuallyCorrelated` fields. 
    To reassign an account from one identity to another, replace the current `identityId` with a new value. 
    If the account you're assigning was provisioned by Identity Security Cloud (ISC), it's possible for ISC to create a new account 
    for the previous identity as soon as the account is moved. If the account you're assigning is authoritative, 
    this causes the previous identity to become uncorrelated and can even result in its deletion.
    All accounts that are reassigned will be set to `manuallyCorrelated: true` unless you specify otherwise.

    >**Note:** The `attributes` field can only be modified for flat file accounts.

  summary: Delete account
  description: >-
    Use this API to delete an account. 

    This endpoint submits an account delete task and returns the task ID. 

    This endpoint only deletes the account from IdentityNow, not the source itself, which can result in the account's returning with the next aggregation between the source and IdentityNow. 
    To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that you [disable accounts](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/disable-account) rather than delete them. This will also allow you to reenable the accounts in the future. 

    A token with ORG_ADMIN, SOURCE_ADMIN, or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API.

    >**NOTE:** You can only delete accounts from sources of the "DelimitedFile" type.**
