  summary: Generate a special token for calling sp-mfa /totp/** apis
  description: >-
    Generates an MFA token and establishes an unverified MFA-on-login context state. 
    Callable by either an internal service or an authenticated user. 
    
    When called by an internal service, the calling service must present the target user's external id as the requestedFor value. 
    
    When called by an authenticated user, the proxying service must present "me" as the the requestedFor value. 
    
    The following rights are required to access this endpoint: sp:mfa-token-all:create, sp:mfa-token-self:create 
    
    If an external id is presented as the request body's requestedFor value, the caller must possess the sp:mfa-token-all:create right. 
    
    This implies that an internal service is obtaining an MFA token on behalf of a user.
