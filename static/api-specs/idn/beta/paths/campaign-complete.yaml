    This endpoint will run successfully for any campaigns that are **past due**.
    
    This endpoint will return a content error if the campaign is **not past due**.

    Use this API to complete a certification campaign. This functionality is provided to admins so that they
    can complete a certification even if all items have not been completed. Though this Beta endpoint has been deprecated, you can find its V3 equivalent [here](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v3/complete-campaign).

    Calling this endpoint requires roles of CERT_ADMIN and ORG_ADMIN.
