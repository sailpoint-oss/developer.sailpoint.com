  summary: Permissions for Entitlement in a Certification
  description: >-
    This API returns the permissions associated with an entitlement that is part of a certification campaign. The
    entitlement provided must match the entitlement from an entitlement certification item, or be part of an access
    profile which has its own access profile certification item. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is
    required to call this API. Reviewers for this certification can also call this API.

        Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)


        Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:


        **target**: *eq, sw*


        **rights**: *ca*


        All field values (second filter operands) are case-insensitive for this API.


        Only a single *and* or *or* composite filter operator may be used. It must also be used between a target filter and a rights filter, not between 2 filters for the same field.


        For example, the following is valid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+target+eq+%22SYS.OBJAUTH2%22`


        The following is invalid: `?filters=rights+ca+(%22CREATE%22)+and+rights+ca+(%SELECT%22)`
