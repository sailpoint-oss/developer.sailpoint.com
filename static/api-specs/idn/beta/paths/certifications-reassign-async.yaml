  summary: Reassign Certifications Asynchronously
  description: >-
    This API initiates a task to reassign up to 500 identities or items in a certification to another reviewer. The

    complete. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is required to call this API. Reviewers for this
    certification can also call this API.
