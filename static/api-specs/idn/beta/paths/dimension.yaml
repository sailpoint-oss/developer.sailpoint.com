  summary: Patch a specified Dimension
  description: >-
    This API updates an existing dimension using [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) syntax.

    The following fields are patchable:
    **name**
    **description**
    **owner**
    **accessProfiles**
    **entitlements**
    **membership**

    A token with API, ORG_ADMIN, ROLE_ADMIN, or ROLE_SUBADMIN authority is required to call this API. In addition, a
    token with ROLE_SUBADMIN authority may only call this API if all access profiles/entitlements included in the dimension are associated
    to Sources with management workgroups of which the ROLE_SUBADMIN is a member.

    The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters.

    When you use this API to modify a dimension's membership identities, you can only modify up to a limit of 500 membership identities at a time.
