    This endpoint initiates a bulk deletion of one or more entitlements.

    When the request is successful, the endpoint returns the bulk delete's task result ID. 
    To follow the task, you can use [Get Task Status by ID](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/internal/entitlements/bulk-delete-status), which will return the task result's status and information. 

    This endpoint can only bulk delete up to a limit of 50 entitlements per request.
