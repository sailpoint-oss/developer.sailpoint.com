  summary: Process a list of identityids
  description: |
    This operation should not be used to schedule your own identity processing or to perform system wide identity refreshes. The system will use a combination of [event-based processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#event-based-processing) and [scheduled processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#scheduled-processing) that runs every day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM in the tenant's timezone to keep your identities synchronized. 
   
    This endpoint will perform the following tasks:
    1. Calculate identity attributes, including applying or running any rules or transforms (e.g. calculate Lifecycle State at a point-in-time it's expected to change).
    2. Evaluate role assignments, leading to assignment of new roles and removal of existing roles.
    3. Enforce provisioning for any assigned accesses that haven't been fulfilled (e.g. failure due to source health).
    4. Recalculate manager relationships.
    5. Potentially clean-up identity processing errors, assuming the error has been resolved.
    
    A token with ORG_ADMIN or HELPDESK authority is required to call this API.
