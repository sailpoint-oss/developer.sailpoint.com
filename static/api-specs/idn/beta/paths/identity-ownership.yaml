    Use this API to return an identity's owned objects that will cause problems for deleting the identity. 
    
    Use this API as a checklist of objects that you need to reassign to a different identity before you can delete the identity. 
    
    For a full list of objects owned by an identity, use the [Search API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v3/search-post/). 
    When you search for identities, the returned identities have a property, `owns`, that contains a more comprehensive list of identity's owned objects.
