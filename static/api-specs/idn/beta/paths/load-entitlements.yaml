    Starts an entitlement aggregation on the specified source. 
    

    If the target source is a direct connection, then the request body must be empty. You will also need to make sure the Content-Type header is not set. If you set the Content-Type header without specifying a body, then you will receive a 500 error.
    
    
    If the target source is a delimited file source, then the CSV file needs to be included in the request body. You will also need to set the Content-Type header to `multipart/form-data`.

    - in: path
