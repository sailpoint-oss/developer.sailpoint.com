  summary: Summary of non-employee approval requests
  description: >-
    This request will retrieve a summary of non-employee approval requests.
    There are two contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter: 1. The
    current user is the Org Admin, in which case he or she may request a summary
    of all non-employee approval requests assigned to a particular approver by
    passing in that approver's id. 2. The current user is an approver, in which
    case "me" should be provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide
    the approver with a summary of the approval items assigned to him or her.
