  summary: Get Summary of Non-Employee Requests
  description: >-
    This request will retrieve a summary of non-employee requests. There are two
    contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter: 1. The current user
    is the Org Admin, in which case he or she may request a summary of all
    non-employee approval requests assigned to a particular account manager by
    passing in that manager's id. 2. The current user is an account manager, in
    which case "me" should be provided as the `requested-for` value. This will
    provide the user with a summary of the non-employee requests in the
    source(s) he or she manages.
