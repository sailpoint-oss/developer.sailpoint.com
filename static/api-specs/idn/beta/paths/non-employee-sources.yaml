  summary: List non-employee sources
  description: |-
    Get a list of non-employee sources. There are two contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter: 
      1. If the user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, he or she may request a list sources assigned to a particular account manager by passing in that manager's `id`.
      2. If the current user is an account manager, the user should provide 'me' as the `requested-for` value. Doing so provide the user with a list of the sources he or she owns.
