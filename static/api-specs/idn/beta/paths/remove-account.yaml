    Use this endpoint to remove accounts from the system without provisioning changes to the source. Accounts that are removed could be re-created during the next aggregation.

    This endpoint is good for:
    * Removing accounts that no longer exist on the source.
    * Removing accounts that won't be aggregated following updates to the source configuration.
    * Forcing accounts to be re-created following the next aggregation to re-run account processing, support testing, etc.
