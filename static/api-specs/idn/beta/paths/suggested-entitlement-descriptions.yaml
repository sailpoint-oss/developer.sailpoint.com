        Sort results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#sorting-results)


        Sorting is supported for the following fields: **displayName, sourceName, status**

        If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored. 
        
        The standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results).
        
        Since requesting a total count can have a performance impact, it is recommended not to send `count=true` if that value will not be used.
      in: query
      name: count
      example: count=true
      schema:
        type: boolean
    - description: >-
        If `true` it will populate the `X-Total-Count` response header with the number of results that would be returned if `limit` and `offset` were ignored.
        
        This parameter differs from the Coun parameter in that this one skip executing the actual query and always return an empty array.
      in: query
      name: count-only
      example: count-only=true
      schema:
