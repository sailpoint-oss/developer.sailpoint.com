  summary: Access request dynamic approval
  operationId: accessRequestDynamicApprovalEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after an access request is submitted but before the request is approved or denied.
    You can use this trigger as a way to route the access request to an additional approval step by an identity or governance group.

    This is a `REQUEST_RESPONSE` event trigger. 
    This trigger type expects a response from the subscribers with directions about how to proceed with the event.
    You can only have one subscriber per event.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Access Request Dynamic Approval](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/access-request-dynamic-approval).

    >**Note: If there is an active subscription to the [Access Request Submitted trigger](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/access-request-submitted), this trigger is invoked after the Access Request Submitted trigger, only if the response to that trigger was to approve the request.**
