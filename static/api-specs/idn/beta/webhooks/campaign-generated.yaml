  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after a certification campaign has generated and moved into the 'Preview Ready' state but hasn't been activated yet. 
    A typical use case for this event trigger is to use it to immediately activate a campaign once it is generated.
    
    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Campaign Generated](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/campaign-generated).
