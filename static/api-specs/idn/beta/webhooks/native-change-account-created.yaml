  summary: Native Change Account Created
  operationId: nativeChangeAccountCreated
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC) aggregates data from an external source and detects that a new account exists on the source.
    The external source must meet these criteria for you to receive this type of event:
      * Native Change Detection (NCD) is enabled.
      * Account Create operations are monitored.
      * At least one attribute selected for monitoring has changed.

    In addition to having NCD enabled, 
    There are two ways to configure a source for NCD: 
      * Invoke the 'Update Native Change Detection' configuration for each source you want to receive NCD events from.
      * Configure the NCD options on the source in the source configuration user interface (UI).
      
    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
