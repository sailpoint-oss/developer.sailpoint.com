  summary: Source Account Created
  operationId: sourceAccountCreated
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after Identity Security Cloud (ISC) detects a new account during an account aggregation and refresh from a source. 
    This trigger cannot determine whether the account creation happened on the source or in ISC. It omits events related to ISC accounts, such as the ISC Admin. 
    
    A typical use for this trigger is to watch for new accounts with highly privileged access, such as an account created in Active Directory Domain Admins.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Source Account Created](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/source-account-created).

    >**Note: This is an early access event trigger. Contact support to enable it on your tenant.**
