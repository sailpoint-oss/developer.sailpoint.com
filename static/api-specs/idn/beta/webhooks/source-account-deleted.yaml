  summary: Source account deleted
  operationId: sourceAccountDeletedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC), during an account aggregation operation, detects that an account has been deleted. 
    This trigger cannot determine whether the account deletion happened on the source or in ISC. It omits events related to ISC accounts, such as the ISC Admin.

    A typical use for this trigger is to watch for deletions of authoritative accounts, such as an account deleted from Workday.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Source Account Created](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/source-account-deleted).

    >**Note: This is an early access event trigger. Contact support to enable it on your tenant.**
