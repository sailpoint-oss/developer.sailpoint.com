  summary: Source Deleted
  operationId: sourceDeleted
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when a new source is deleted from Identity Security Cloud (ISC), by either the [API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/delete-source) or the [Admin UI](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html#deleting-a-source). 

    These are some typical use cases for the trigger:
      * Provide evidence to auditors to show that connector logic and sources are maintained by proper change control processes and aren't vulnerable to outside manipulation. 
      * Alert admins when a source is incorrectly deleted. 

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Source Created](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/source-deleted).
