        OAuth2 Bearer token (JWT) generated using either a [personal access token (PAT)](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/authentication/#generate-a-personal-access-token) or through the [authorization code flow](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/authentication/#request-access-token-with-authorization-code-grant-flow).

        Personal access tokens are associated with a user in Identity Security Cloud and relies on the user's [user level](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/index.html) (ex. Admin, Helpdesk, etc.) to determine a base level of access.
