    description: |
      Use this API to implement and customize access request approval functionality. 
      With this functionality in place, administrators can delegate qualified users to review users' requests for access or managers' requests to revoke team members' access to applications, entitlements, or roles.      
      This enables more qualified users to review access requests and the others to spend their time on other tasks.  
      
      In IdentityNow, users can request access to applications, entitlements, and roles, and managers can request that team members' access be revoked.   
      For applications and entitlements, administrators can set access profiles to require approval from the access profile owner, the application owner, the source owner, the requesting user's manager, or a governance group for access to be granted or revoked.   
      For roles, administrators can also set roles to allow access requests and require approval from the role owner, the requesting user's manager, or a governance group for access to be granted or revoked.   
      If the administrator designates a governance group as the required approver, any governance group member can approve the requests.
         
      When a user submits an access request, IdentityNow sends the first required approver in the queue an email notification, based on the access request configuration's approval and reminder escalation configuration.

      In Approvals in IdentityNow, required approvers can view pending access requests under the Requested tab and approve or deny them, or the approvers can reassign the requests to different reviewers for approval.   
      If the required approver approves the request and is the only reviewer required, IdentityNow grants or revokes access, based on the request.   
      If multiple reviewers are required, IdentityNow sends the request to the next reviewer in the queue, based on the access request configuration's approval reminder and escalation configuration.   
      The required approver can then view any completed access requests under the Reviewed tab.   
      
      Refer to the following link for more information about access request approvals.

  - name: Access Requests
    description: |
      Use this API to implement and customize access request functionality. 
      With this functionality in place, users can request access to applications, entitlements, or roles, and managers can request that team members' access be revoked.
      This allows users to get access to the tools they need quickly and securely, and it allows managers to take away access to those tools. 
      
      IdentityNow's Access Request service allows end users to request access that requires approval before it can be granted to users and enables qualified users to review those requests and approve or deny them.
      
      In the Request Center in IdentityNow, users can view available applications, roles, and entitlements and request access to them. 
      If the requested tools requires approval, the requests appear as 'Pending' under the My Requests tab until the required approver approves, rejects, or cancels them. 

      Users can use My Requests to track and/or cancel the requests.

      In My Team on the IdentityNow Home, managers can submit requests to revoke their team members' access. 
      They can use the My Requests tab under Request Center to track and/or cancel the requests.
      
      Refer to the following link for more information about access requests.

  - name: Accounts
    description: |
      Use this API to implement and customize account functionality.
      With this functionality in place, administrators can manage users' access across sources in IdentityNow. 

      In IdentityNow, an account refers to a user's account on a supported source.
      This typically includes a unique identifier for the user, a unique password, a set of permissions associated with the source and a set of attributes. IdentityNow loads accounts through the creation of sources in IdentityNow.

      Administrators can correlate users' identities with the users' accounts on the different sources they use. 
      This allows IdentityNow to govern the access of identities and all their correlated accounts securely and cohesively. 

      To view the accounts on a source and their correlated identities, administrators can use the Connections drop-down menu, select Sources, select the relevant source, and select its Account tab. 

      To view and edit source account statuses for an identity in IdentityNow, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu, select Identity List, select the relevant identity, and select its Accounts tab. 
      Administrators can toggle an account's Actions to aggregate the account, enable/disable it, unlock it, or remove it from the identity. 
      
      Accounts can have the following statuses: 

      - Enabled: The account is enabled. The user can access it.

      - Disabled: The account is disabled, and the user cannot access it, but the identity is not disabled in IdentityNow. This can occur when an administrator disables the account or when the user's lifecycle state changes. 

      - Locked: The account is locked. This may occur when someone has entered an incorrect password for the account too many times.

      - Pending: The account is currently updating. This status typically lasts seconds. 

      Administrators can select the source account to view its attributes, entitlements, and the last time the account's password was changed.

      Refer to the following link for more information about accounts:

      url: https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/users/user_access.html 
  - name: Account Activities
    description: |
      Use this API to implement account activity tracking functionality.
      With this functionality in place, users can track source account activity in IdentityNow, which greatly improves traceability in the system. 

      An account activity refers to a log of each action performed on a source account. This is useful for auditing the changes performed on an account throughout its life. 
      In IdentityNow's Search, users can search for account activities and select the activity's row to get an overview of the activity's account action and view its progress, its involved sources, and its most basic metadata, such as the identity requesting the option and the recipient. 

      Account activity includes most actions IdentityNow completes on source accounts. Users can search in IdentityNow for the following account action types: 

      - Access Request: These include any access requests the source account is involved in. 

      - Account Attribute Updates: These include updates to a single attribute on an account on a source. 

      - Account State Update: These include locking or unlocking actions on an account on a source. 

      - Certification: These include actions removing an entitlement from an account on a source as a result of the entitlement's revocation during a certification.

      - Cloud Automated <Lifecyclestate>: These include automated lifecycle state changes that result in a source account's correlated identity being assigned to a different lifecycle state. 
      IdentityNow replaces the <Lifecyclestate> variable with the name of the lifecycle state it has moved the account's identity to. 

      - Identity Attribute Update: These include updates to a source account's correlated identity attributes as the result of a provisioning action. 
      When you update an identity attribute that also updates an identity's lifecycle state, the cloud automated <Lifecyclestate> event also displays.
      Account Activity does not include attribute updates that occur as a result of aggregation.

      - Identity Refresh: These include correlated identity refreshes that occur for an account on a source whenever the account's correlated identity profile gets a new role or updates. 
      These also include refreshes that occur whenever IdentityNow assigns an application to the account's correlated identity based on the application's being assigned to All Users From Source or Specific Users From Source. 

      - Lifecycle State Refresh: These include the actions that took place when a lifecycle state changed. This event only occurs after a cloud automated <Lifecyclestate> change or a lifecycle state change. 

      - Lifecycle State Change: These include the account activities that result from an identity's manual assignment to a null lifecycle state.

      - Password Change: These include password changes on sources.

  - name: Identity Profiles
    description: |
      Use this API to implement identity profile functionality. 
      With this functionality in place, administrators can view identity profiles and their configurations. 
      
      Identity profiles represent the configurations that can be applied to identities as a way of granting them a set of security and access, as well as defining the mappings between their identity attributes and their source attributes.  

      In IdentityNow, administrators can use the Identities drop-down menu and select Identity Profiles to view the list of identity profiles. 
      This list shows some details about each identity profile, along with its status. 
      They can select an identity profile to view its settings, its mappings between identity attributes and correlating source account attributes, and its provisioning settings. 
      
      Refer to the following link for more information about identity profiles:

  - name: Non-Employee Lifecycle Management
  - name: OAuth Clients
  - name: Password Management
    description: |
      Use this API to implement password management functionality.  
      With this functionality in place, users can manage their identity passwords for all their applications.

      In IdentityNow, users can select their names in the upper right corner of the page and use the drop-down menu to select Password Manager. 
      Password Manager lists the user's identity's applications, possibly grouped to share passwords. 
      Users can then select 'Change Password' to update their passwords. 

      Grouping passwords allows users to update their passwords more broadly, rather than requiring them to update each password individually. 
      Password Manager may list the applications and sources in the following groups:

      - Password Group: This refers to a group of applications that share a password. 
      For example, a user can use the same password for Google Drive, Google Mail, and YouTube. 
      Updating the password for the password group updates the password for all its included applications.

      - Multi-Application Source: This refers to a source with multiple applications that share a password. 
      For example, a user can have a source, G Suite, that includes the Google Calendar, Google Drive, and Google Mail applications. 
      Updating the password for the multi-application source updates the password for all its included applications. 

      - Applications: These are applications that do not share passwords with other applications.

      An organization may require some authentication for users to update their passwords. 
      Users may be required to answer security questions or use a third-party authenticator before they can confirm their updates. 

      Refer to the following link for more information about password management: 
    externalDocs:
      description: Learn more about password management
      url: https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/user-help/accounts/passwords.html
  - name: Personal Access Tokens  
    description: |
      Use this API to implement personal access token (PAT) functionality. 
      With this functionality in place, users can use PATs as an alternative to passwords for authentication in IdentityNow. 

      PATs embed user information into the client ID and secret. 
      This replaces the API clients' need to store and provide a username and password to establish a connection, improving IdentityNow organizations' integration security. 

      In IdentityNow, users can do the following to create and manage their PATs: Select the dropdown menu under their names, select Preferences, and then select Personal Access Tokens. 
      They must then provide a description about the token's purpose. 
      They can then select 'Create Token' at the bottom of the page to generate and view the Secret and Client ID. 

      Refer to the following link for more information about PATs:

      url: https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/common/generate_tokens.html.
  - name: Public Identities
    description: |
      Use this API in conjunction with [Public Identites Config](https://developer.sailpoint.com/apis/v3/#tag/Public-Identities-Config) to enable non-administrators to view identities' publicly visible attributes. 
      With this functionality in place, non-administrators can view identity attributes other than the default attributes (email, lifecycle state, and manager), depending on which identity attributes their organization administrators have made public. 
      This can be helpful for access approvers, certification reviewers, managers viewing their direct reports' access, and source owners viewing their tasks.
  - name: Public Identities Config
    description: |
      Use this API to implement public identity configuration functionality. 
      With this functionality in place, administrators can make up to 5 identity attributes publicly visible so other non-administrator users can see the relevant information they need to make decisions. 
      This can be helpful for approvers making approvals, certification reviewers, managers viewing their direct reports' access, and source owners viewing their tasks.

      By default, non-administrators can select an identity and view the following attributes: email, lifecycle state, and manager. 
      However, it may be helpful for a non-administrator reviewer to see other identity attributes like department, region, title, etc.
      Administrators can use this API to make those necessary identity attributes public to non-administrators. 

      For example, a non-administrator deciding whether to approve another identity's request for access to the Workday application, whose access may be restricted to members of the HR department, would want to know whether the identity is a member of the HR department. 
      If an administrator has used [Update Public Identity Config](https://developer.sailpoint.com/apis/v3/#operation/updatePublicIdentityConfig) to make the "department" attribute public, the approver can see the department and make a decision without requesting any more information.

    description: |
      The purpose of this API is to expose functionality for the manipulation of Transform objects.
      Transforms are a form of configurable objects which define an easy way to manipulate attribute data without having
      to write code. These endpoints don't require API calls to other resources, audit service is used for keeping track
      of which users have made changes to the Transforms.
