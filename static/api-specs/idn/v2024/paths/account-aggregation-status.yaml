  description: 'This API returns the status of an *in-progress* account aggregation,
    along with the total number of **NEW**, **CHANGED** and **DELETED** accounts found
    since the previous aggregation, and the number of those accounts that have been
    processed so far.


    Accounts that have not changed since the previous aggregation are not included
    in **totalAccounts** and **processedAccounts** counts returned by this API. This
    is distinct from **Accounts Scanned** shown in the Aggregation UI, which indicates
    total accounts scanned regardless of whether they changed or not.


    Since this endpoint reports on the status of an *in-progress* account aggregation,
    totalAccounts and processedAccounts may change between calls to this endpoint.


    *Only available up to an hour after the aggregation completes. May respond with
    *404 Not Found* after that.*
