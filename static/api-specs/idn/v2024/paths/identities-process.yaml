  summary: Process a list of identityIds
  description: "This operation should not be used to schedule your own identity processing\
    \ or to perform system wide identity refreshes. The system will use a combination\
    \ of [event-based processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#event-based-processing)\
    \ and [scheduled processing](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/setup/identity_processing.html?h=process#scheduled-processing)\
    \ that runs every day at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM in the tenant's timezone to keep\
    \ your identities synchronized. \n\nThis endpoint will perform the following tasks:\n\
    1. Calculate identity attributes, including applying or running any rules or transforms\
    \ (e.g. calculate Lifecycle State at a point-in-time it's expected to change).\n\
    2. Evaluate role assignments, leading to assignment of new roles and removal of\
    \ existing roles.\n3. Enforce provisioning for any assigned accesses that haven't\
    \ been fulfilled (e.g. failure due to source health).\n4. Recalculate manager\
    \ relationships.\n5. Potentially clean-up identity processing errors, assuming\
    \ the error has been resolved."
