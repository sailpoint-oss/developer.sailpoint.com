  summary: Reassign certifications asynchronously
  description: >-
    This API initiates a task to reassign up to 500 identities or items in an identity campaign certification to another
    reviewer. The `certification-tasks` API can be used to get an updated status on the task and determine when the
    reassignment is complete. A token with ORG_ADMIN or CERT_ADMIN authority is required to call this API. Reviewers for
    this certification can also call this API.
