  summary: Aggregate entitlements
  deprecated: true
  operationId: importEntitlementsBySource
  description: |-
    Starts an entitlement aggregation on the specified source. Though this endpoint has been deprecated, you can find its Beta equivalent [here](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/beta/import-entitlements).

    If the target source is a direct connection, then the request body must be empty. You will also need to make sure the Content-Type header is not set. If you set the Content-Type header without specifying a body, then you will receive a 500 error.

    If the target source is a delimited file source, then the CSV file needs to be included in the request body. You will also need to set the Content-Type header to `multipart/form-data`.
