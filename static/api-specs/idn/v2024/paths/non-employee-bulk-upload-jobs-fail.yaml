  summary: Fail Bulk Upload
  description: |
    This API does not stop the job. It flags the job as failed. The job continues to run if it was 
    running when the API was invoked.

    Before you submit this request, verify the transaction is actually failed in Kibana. When 
    the NON_EMPLOYEE_CREATE_PASSED events have stopped, then the job is completed. 

    Important: This API does not stop the job, it flags the job as failed. The job continues to run if 
    the it was running when the API was invoked. If invoked while the transaction is still running, 
    other jobs are allowed to start but the second job to start will fail. 

    Requires role context of `idn:nesr:update`. 

    This is for internal use only.
