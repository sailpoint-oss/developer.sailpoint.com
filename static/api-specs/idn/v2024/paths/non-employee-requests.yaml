  summary: List Non-Employee Requests
  description: >-
    This gets a list of non-employee requests. There are two contextual
    uses for the `requested-for` path parameter:
      1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or
    she may request a list non-employee requests assigned to a particular
    account manager by passing in that manager's id.
      2. The current user is an account manager, in which case "me" should be
    provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a
    list of the non-employee requests in the source(s) he or she manages.
