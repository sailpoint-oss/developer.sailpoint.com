  summary: Remove All Accounts in a Source
  tags:
  - Sources
  description: 'Use this endpoint to remove all accounts from the system without provisioning
    changes to the source. Accounts that are removed could be re-created during the
    next aggregation.


    This endpoint is good for:

    * Removing accounts that no longer exist on the source.

    * Removing accounts that won''t be aggregated following updates to the source
    configuration.

    * Forcing accounts to be re-created following the next aggregation to re-run account
    processing, support testing, etc.
