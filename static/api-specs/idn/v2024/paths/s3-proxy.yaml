  summary: Retrieves an artifact from s3.
  tags:
    - S3 Access
  description: >-
    Accepts a path from S3 and the bucket type either shared or org.  The bucket in which the artifact resides is provided
    to the runtime service by an environment variable controlled by devops.  This is also true for the S3 creds as they
    are available to the service at runtime.

    If the bucket type is shared, no further validation is needed.  If the bucket type is org, the information in the JWT
    is validated against the path query parameter.  A token with API authority is required to access this endpoint..
