  summary: List Workflow Executions
  description: >-
    Use this API to list a specified workflow's executions. Workflow executions are available for up to 90 days before being archived.
    By default, you can get a maximum of 250 executions. 
    To get executions past the first 250 records, you can do the following: 

    1. Use the [Get Workflows](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/list-workflows) endpoint to get your workflows. 

    2. Get your workflow ID from the response. 

    3. You can then do either of the following: 

      - Filter to find relevant workflow executions.
      For example, you can filter for failed workflow executions: `GET /workflows/:workflowID/executions?filters=status eq "Failed"`
    
      - Paginate through results with the `offset` parameter. 
      For example, you can page through 50 executions per page and use that as a way to get to the records past the first 250. 
      Refer to [Paginating Results](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results) for more information about the query parameters you can use to achieve pagination.
