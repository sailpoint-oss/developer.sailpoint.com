  summary: Native Change Account Updated
  operationId: nativeChangeAccountUpdatedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC) aggregates data from an external source and detects that an account has been updated on the source.
    The external source must meet these criteria for you to receive this type of event:
      * Native Change Detection (NCD) is enabled.
      * Account Update operations are monitored.
      * At least one attribute selected for monitoring has changed.
      
    In addition to having NCD enabled, 
    There are two ways to configure a source for NCD: 
      * Invoke the 'Update Native Change Detection' configuration for each source you want to receive NCD events from.
      * Configure the NCD options on the source in the source configuration user interface (UI).

    A typical use for this event trigger would be to notify the correlated identity's manager and the source owner when the account is deleted.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
