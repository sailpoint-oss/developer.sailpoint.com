    Use this API to generate a new certification campaign from a campaign template.

    The campaign object contained in the template has special formatting applied to its name and description
    fields that determine the generated campaign's name/description. Placeholders in those fields are
    formatted with the current date and time upon generation.

    Placeholders consist of a percent sign followed by a letter indicating what should be inserted. For
    example, "%Y" inserts the current year, and a campaign template named "Campaign for %y" generates a
    campaign called "Campaign for 2020" (assuming the year at generation time is 2020).

    Valid placeholders are the date/time conversion suffix characters supported by [java.util.Formatter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Formatter.html).
