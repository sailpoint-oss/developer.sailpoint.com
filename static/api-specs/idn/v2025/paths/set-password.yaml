    This API is used to set a password for an identity. 

    An identity can change their own password (as well as any of their accounts' passwords) if they use a token generated by their ISC user, such as a [personal access token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#personal-access-tokens) or ["authorization_code" derived OAuth token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#authorization-code-grant-flow).

    >**Note: If you want to set an identity's source account password, you must enable `PASSWORD` as one of the source's features. You can use the [PATCH Source endpoint](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v3/update-source) to add the `PASSWORD` feature.**

    To generate the encryptedPassword (RSA encrypted using publicKey) for the request body, run the following command:

    ```bash
    echo -n "myPassword" | openssl pkeyutl -encrypt -inkey public_key.pem -pubin | base64
    ```

    In this example, myPassword is the plain text password being set and encrypted, and public_key.pem is the path to the public key file. You can retrieve the required publicKey, along with other information like identityId, sourceId, publicKeyId, accounts, and policies, using the Query Password Info endpoint.

    To successfully run this command, you must have OpenSSL installed on your machine. If OpenSSL is unavailable, consider using the Virtual Appliance (VA), which has OpenSSL pre-installed and configured.

    If you are using a Windows machine, refer to this [guide](https://tecadmin.net/install-openssl-on-windows/) for instructions on installing OpenSSL.

    You can then use [Get Password Change Request Status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/get-password-change-status) to check the password change request status. To do so, you must provide the `requestId` from your earlier request to set the password.
