  operationId: accessRequestSubmittedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after an access request is submitted but before the request is approved or denied. 
    A service subscribing to the trigger can respond in real-time to approve or deny the request.
    
    This is a `REQUEST_RESPONSE` event trigger. 
    This trigger type expects a response from the subscribers with directions about how to proceed with the event.
    You can only have one subscriber per event.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Access Request Submitted](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/access-request-submitted).
