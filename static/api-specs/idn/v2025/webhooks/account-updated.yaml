  summary: Account updated
  operationId: accountUpdatedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when an account is updated in Identity Security Cloud.

    Accounts can be updated via aggregations or provisioning, including when entitlements are added or removed.

    You could use this event trigger to fire a Workflow that takes additional actions after a new entitlement has been provisioned to a privileged account.

    See [Aggregating Accounts](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/index.html#aggregating-accounts) and [Configuring Source Account Provisioning](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/create_profile.html) for more information about the scenarios that lead to account updates.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Account Updated](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/account-updated).
