  summary: Identity deleted
  operationId: identityDeletedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires after an identity has been completely deleted from Identity Security Cloud (ISC).
    ISC only deletes an identity when it meets all these requirements: 
      * It has no correlated accounts.
      * It's not an owner of a role, access profile, application, source, or task result. 
      * It's not an owner or requester of a work item.
      * It's not a protected account or manager.
      * It has no assigned capabilities, such as being an assigned certification reviewer.
      * It's not involved in any active certification as a target (its access is not being certified).
    
    These are some typical use cases for the trigger:
      * Notify an administrator or system to take the appropriate provisioning actions as part of the leaver workflow.
      * Notify a system to trigger another action, such as deactivating an employee's badge upon termination.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
