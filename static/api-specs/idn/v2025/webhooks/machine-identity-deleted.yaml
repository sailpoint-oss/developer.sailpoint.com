  summary: Machine Identity Deleted
  operationId: machineIdentityDeletedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when a machine identity is deleted in Identity Security Cloud.

    Machine identities can be deleted via the UI, endpoint, or aggregations. Machine identities can also be auto-deleted when all account correlations to the machine identity are removed.

    You could use this event trigger to fire a Workflow that notifies machine identity owners when a machine identity is decommissioned.
