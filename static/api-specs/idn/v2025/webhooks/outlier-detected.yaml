  summary: Outlier detected
  operationId: outlierDetectedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC) detects that identities have unusual access relative their peers.
    ISC calculates outliers daily, flags the outliers, and notifies the trigger's subscribers when it detects them.

    These are the requirements to use the trigger:
      * Your organization must have Access Insights, which it needs to access Identity Outliers.
      * Your organization must have at a configured source that it has loaded account data from.
      * Your organization's accound data must be onboarded into AI-Driven Identity Security.

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
