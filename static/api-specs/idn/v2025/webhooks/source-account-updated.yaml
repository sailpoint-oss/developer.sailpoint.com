  summary: Source account updated
  operationId: sourceAccountUpdatedEvent
  description: >-
    This event trigger fires when Identity Security Cloud (ISC), during an account aggregation operation, detects a change to one or more account attributes on a single account. 
    This trigger cannot determine whether the account update happened on the source or in ISC. It omits events related to ISC accounts, such as the ISC Admin.

    These actions are considered updated:
      * An update to account attributes
      * Enabling or disabling an account
      * Locking or unlocking an account
      * A change to a source account password
    
    A typical use for this trigger is to watch for updates to accounts that add highly privileged access, such as an account that is granted privileged access on a sensitive source. 

    This is a `FIRE_AND_FORGET` event trigger. 
    You can have a maximum of 50 subscriptions for this trigger.
    For more information about this event trigger, refer to [Source Account Created](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/event-triggers/triggers/source-account-updated).

    >**Note: This is an early access event trigger. Contact support to enable it on your tenant.**
