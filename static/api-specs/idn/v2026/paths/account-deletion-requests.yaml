  summary: List of Account Deletion Requests
  description: Retrieves a paginated list of account deletion requests filtered by the provided query parameters. When the "mine" parameter is set to true, the response includes only those deletion requests that were initiated by the currently authenticated user. If "mine" is false or not specified, the endpoint returns all account deletion requests associated with the current tenant, regardless of the initiator. This allows both users and administrators to view relevant deletion requests based on their access level and intent.
