  summary: Access request status
  description: >-
    Use this API to return a list of access request statuses
    based on the specified query parameters.

    If an access request was made for access that an identity already has, the API ignores the access request. 
    These ignored requests do not display in the list of access request statuses.

    Any user with any user level can get the status of their own access requests. A user with
    ORG_ADMIN is required to call this API to get a list of statuses
    for other users.
