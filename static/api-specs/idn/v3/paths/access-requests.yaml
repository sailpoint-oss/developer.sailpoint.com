    Use this API to submit an access request in Identity Security Cloud (ISC), where it follows any ISC approval processes.

    :::info
    The ability to request access using this API is constrained by the Access Request Segments defined in the API token’s user context.
    :::
    
    Access requests are processed asynchronously by ISC. A successful response from this endpoint means that the request
    has been submitted to ISC and is queued for processing. Because this endpoint is asynchronous, it doesn't return an error
    if you submit duplicate access requests in quick succession or submit an access request for access that is already in progress, approved, or rejected.

    It's best practice to check for any existing access requests that reference the same access items before submitting a new access request. This can
    be accomplished by using the [List Access Request Status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-access-request-status) or the [Pending Access Request Approvals](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-pending-approvals) APIs. You can also
    use the [Search API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/search) to check the existing access items an identity has before submitting
    an access request to ensure that you aren't requesting access that is already granted. If you use this API to request access that an identity already has, 
    without changing the account details or end date information from the existing assignment, 
    the API will cancel the request as a duplicate.
  
    There are two types of access request:
    
    __GRANT_ACCESS__
    * Can be requested for multiple identities in a single request.
    * Supports self request and request on behalf of other users. Refer to the [Get Access Request Configuration](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/get-access-request-config) endpoint for request configuration options.  
    * Allows any authenticated token (except API) to call this endpoint to request to grant access to themselves. Depending on the configuration, a user can request access for others.
    * Roles, access profiles and entitlements can be requested.
    * You can specify a `removeDate` to set or alter a sunset date-time on an assignment. The removeDate must be a future date-time, in the UTC timezone. Additionally, if the user already has the access assigned with a sunset date, you can also submit a request without a `removeDate` to request removal of the sunset date and time.
    * If a `removeDate` is specified, then the requested role, access profile, or entitlement will be removed on that date and time.
    * While requesting entitlements, maximum of 25 entitlements and 10 recipients are allowed in a request.
    * Now supports an alternate field 'requestedForWithRequestedItems' for users to specify account selections while requesting items where they have more than one account on the source.
     
    __REVOKE_ACCESS__
    * Can only be requested for a single identity at a time.
    * You cannot use an access request to revoke access from an identity if that access has been granted by role membership or by birthright provisioning. 
    * Does not support self request. Only manager can request to revoke access for their directly managed employees.
    * If a `removeDate` is specified, then the requested role, access profile, or entitlement will be removed on that date and time.
    * Roles, access profiles, and entitlements can be requested for revocation.
    * Revoke requests for entitlements are limited to 1 entitlement per access request currently.
    * You can specify a `removeDate` to add or alter a sunset date and time on an assignment. The `removeDate` must be a future date-time, in the UTC timezone. If the user already has the access assigned with a sunset date and time, the removeDate must be a date-time earlier than the existing sunset date and time. 
    * Allows a manager to request to revoke access for direct employees. A user with ORG_ADMIN authority can also request to revoke access from anyone.
    * Now supports REVOKE_ACCESS requests for identities with multiple accounts on a single source, with the help of 'assignmentId' and 'nativeIdentity' fields. These fields should be used within the 'requestedItems' section for the revoke requests. 
    * Usage of 'requestedForWithRequestedItems' field is not supported for revoke requests.
