      A list of auth user update operations according to the [JSON Patch](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902) standard.

      PATCH can only be applied to the following fields:
        *   "capabilities"

      A list of valid capabilities can be found using the GET ams/v3/authorization/authorization-capabilities/ endpoint.
      Capabilities can only be patched if they are administrator assignable, as indicated by the 'adminAssignable' field from the output of list authorization-capabilities.
      Capabilities that have a legacy group ('legacyGroup' field) need to be patched using the legacyGroup name (e.g. 'ORG_ADMIN').
      Capabilities that are adminAssignable but do not have a legacyGroup can be patched using the ams id (e.g. 'cam:new-role').

      A 400.1.1 Illegal update attempt detail code indicates that you attempted to PATCH a field that is not allowed.
