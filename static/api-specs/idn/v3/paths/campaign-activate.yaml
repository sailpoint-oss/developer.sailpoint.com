      Optional. If no timezone is specified, the standard UTC timezone is used (i.e. UTC+00:00).
      Although this can take any timezone, the intended value is the caller's timezone. The activation time
      calculated from the given timezone may cause the campaign deadline time to be modified, but it will remain
      within the original date. The timezone must be in a valid ISO 8601 format.
