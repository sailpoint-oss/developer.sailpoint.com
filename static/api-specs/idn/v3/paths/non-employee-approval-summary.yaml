  summary: Get Summary of Non-Employee Approval Requests
  description: >-
    This request will retrieve a summary of non-employee approval requests.
    There are two contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter:
      1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or
    she may request a summary of all non-employee approval requests assigned to
    a particular approver by passing in that approver's id.
      2. The current user is an approver, in which case "me" should be provided
    as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the approver with a summary
    of the approval items assigned to him or her.
  parameters:
