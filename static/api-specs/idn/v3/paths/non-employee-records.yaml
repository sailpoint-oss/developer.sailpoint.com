    This gets a list of non-employee records.
    There are two contextual uses for this endpoint:
      1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case they can get a list of all of the non-employees.
      2. The user is an account manager, in which case they can get a list of the non-employees that they manage.
