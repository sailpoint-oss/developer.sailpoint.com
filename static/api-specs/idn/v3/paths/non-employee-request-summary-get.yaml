  summary: Get Summary of Non-Employee Requests
  description: >-
    This request will retrieve a summary of non-employee requests. There are two
    contextual uses for the `requested-for` path parameter:
      1. The user has the role context of `idn:nesr:read`, in which case he or
    she may request a summary of all non-employee approval requests assigned to
    a particular account manager by passing in that manager's id.
      2. The current user is an account manager, in which case "me" should be
    provided as the `requested-for` value. This will provide the user with a
    summary of the non-employee requests in the source(s) he or she manages.
  parameters:
    - in: path
      name: requested-for
      description: >-
        The identity (UUID) of the non-employee account manager for whom the
        summary is being retrieved. Use "me" instead to indicate the current
        user.
