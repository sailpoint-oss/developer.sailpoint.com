    The following fields are patchable:

    * name

    * description

    * enabled

    * owner

    * accessProfiles

    * entitlements

    * membership

    * requestable

    * accessRequestConfig

    * revokeRequestConfig

    * segments
    
    * accessModelMetadata


    A user with ROLE_SUBADMIN authority may only call this API if all access profiles included in the role are associated
    to sources with management workgroups of the ROLE_SUBADMIN is a member of.


    The maximum supported length for the description field is 2000 characters.
    ISC preserves longer descriptions for existing roles. However, any new roles as well as any updates to existing descriptions are limited to 2000 characters.


    When you use this API to modify a role's membership identities, you can only modify up to a limit of 500 membership identities at a time.
