    Performs a search query aggregation and returns the aggregation result.
    By default, you can page a maximum of 10,000 search result records. 
    To page past 10,000 records, you can use searchAfter paging. 
    Refer to [Paginating Search Queries](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-search-queries) for more information about how to implement searchAfter paging.
