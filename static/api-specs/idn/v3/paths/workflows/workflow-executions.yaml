  summary: List workflow executions
  description: >-
    Use this API to list a specified workflow's executions. Workflow executions are available for up to 90 days before being archived.
    By default, you can get a maximum of 250 executions.
    To get executions past the first 250 records, you can do the following:

    1. Use the [Get Workflows](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/beta/list-workflows) endpoint to get your workflows.

    2. Get your workflow ID from the response.

    3. You can then do either of the following:

      - Filter to find relevant workflow executions.
      For example, you can filter for failed workflow executions: `GET /workflows/:workflowID/executions?filters=status eq "Failed"`

      - Paginate through results with the `offset` parameter.
      For example, you can page through 50 executions per page and use that as a way to get to the records past the first 250.
      Refer to [Paginating Results](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results) for more information about the query parameters you can use to achieve pagination.

        Filter results using the standard syntax described in [V3 API Standard Collection Parameters](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#filtering-results)


        Filtering is supported for the following fields and operators:


        **start_time**: *eq, lt, le, gt, ge*


        **status**: *eq*
      example: status eq "Failed"
      required: false
