  Query parameters used to construct an Elasticsearch query object.
properties:
  query:
    description: >-
      The query using the Elasticsearch [Query String Query](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.2/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string) syntax from the Query DSL extended by SailPoint to support Nested queries.
    type: string
    example: 'name:a*'
  fields:
    description: >-
      The fields the query will be applied to. 
      Fields provide you with a simple way to add additional fields to search, without making the query too complicated. 
      For example, you can use the fields to specify that you want your query of "a*" to be applied to "name", "firstName", and the "source.name". 
      The response will include all results matching the "a*" query found in those three fields. 

      A field's availability depends on the indices being searched. 
      For example, if you are searching "identities", you can apply your search to the "firstName" field, but you couldn't use "firstName" with a search on "access profiles". 
      Refer to the response schema for the respective lists of available fields.
