name: after_id
in: query
description: Represents the ID where the query should begin from. If blank, it represents the first ID. When used, forces sorting by ID ascending and does not allow use of `offset`. When after_id is specified it changes the mode of the API such that any filter parameters other than profile_type_id, limit, and offset are not supported and will be either silently ignored or result in an HTTP 400 error. For example you can not include and after_id along with an archived=false in the same request.
